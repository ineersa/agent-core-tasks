# PHAR Packaging with humbug/box

## Goal
## Goal
Package agent-core as a single PHAR file using humbug/box, with a Castor build command and real validation against llama.cpp.

## Why
Single-binary distribution for the CLI agent. Eliminates `composer install` requirement on target machines. The codebase is ~70% PHAR-ready already (see scout analysis).

## Context
- humbug/box is installed globally (`box` command available)
- Symfony 8.1 console-only app, no HTTP stack
- `AppResourceLocator` and `app.cwd` (getcwd()) already handle PHAR-safe paths
- `.hatfield/` paths resolve against CWD, not PHAR location
- `ConsumerSupervisor` already uses `$_SERVER['argv'][0]` for entrypoint resolution
- Native extension `php-llama/llama-cpp-bindings` cannot be bundled (system requirement)
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Process/AGENTS.md` documents planned `BinaryLocator` pattern

## What works inside PHAR already
- Container boot, config loading, service wiring
- `.hatfield/` paths (sessions, SQLite messenger, logs, cache)
- Theme/settings loading via AppResourceLocator
- `$_SERVER['argv'][0]` for child process spawning (ConsumerSupervisor)

## What needs fixing
### 1. Remaining `dirname(__DIR__, N)` references
Some files still use hardcoded path resolution instead of `$_SERVER['argv'][0]` or container params:
- `JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient.php` — `dirname(__DIR__, 4)`
- `AgentProcessSupervisor.php` — takes console path from caller
- Any remaining hardcoded paths in headless mode

### 2. Box configuration (box.json)
Create `box.json` with:
```json
{
    "directories": ["src", "config", "vendor"],
    "files": ["bin/console", ".env"],
    "output": "coding-agent.phar",
    "compression": "GZ",
    "algorithm": "SHA256",
    "main": "bin/console",
    "php-extensions": ["pdo_sqlite"],
    "exclude-composer-files": false,
    "force-heresies": true,
    "dev": false
}
```

Key flags:
- `force-heresies: true` — Symfony uses reflection for autowiring
- `exclude-composer-files: false` — AbstractKernel needs composer.json for getProjectDir()
- `dev: false` — exclude phpunit, phpstan, cs-fixer from PHAR

### 3. Castor command
- `castor phar:build` — runs `box compile` and reports output path + size

### 4. PHPUnit test (not a Castor command)
Create `tests/CodingAgent/Phar/PharSmokeTest.php` following the same pattern as `LlamaCppSmokeTest` and `TuiAgentSmokeTest`:
- `#[Group('llm-real')]` — same group as existing real tests, runs via `castor test:llm-real`
- Creates a temp directory in `./var/` with a fresh CWD for isolation
- Builds the PHAR (or expects pre-built)
- Launches PHAR in tmux: `php coding-agent.phar agent 2>&1`
- Sends a few prompts ("Say exactly: hello", "Say exactly: world")
- Waits for assistant responses in transcript
- Takes TUI snapshots
- Asserts:
  - At least 2 user blocks (❯) and 2 assistant blocks (◇) in correct order
  - `.hatfield/sessions/*/events.jsonl` exists and is non-empty
  - `.hatfield/sessions/*/state.json` exists and contains expected status
  - `.hatfield/sessions/*/transcript.jsonl` exists and is non-empty
  - `.hatfield/messenger.sqlite` exists
  - All paths are relative to temp CWD, not inside PHAR
- Dumps snapshots + session artifacts to stdout on failure
- Cleans up temp directory in tearDown

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `box.json` committed with correct Symfony settings
- [ ] `castor phar:build` generates working `coding-agent.phar`
- [ ] PHAR boots container and responds to `php coding-agent.phar list`
- [ ] PHAR launches TUI in tmux via PHPUnit test
- [ ] Test sends multiple prompts, verifies responses in transcript
- [ ] TUI snapshots captured on failure
- [ ] Session artifacts verified at correct CWD-relative paths (not inside PHAR)
- [ ] `.hatfield/messenger.sqlite` exists relative to CWD
- [ ] Temp directory in `./var/` created and cleaned up
- [ ] All hardcoded `dirname(__DIR__, N)` paths eliminated or PHAR-safe
- [ ] PHAR size is reasonable (< 20MB compressed)
- [ ] `castor check` passes on source code

## Acceptance criteria
- box.json committed with force-heresies + exclude-composer-files:false
- castor phar:build generates coding-agent.phar
- PHAR boots: php coding-agent.phar list shows commands
- PHPUnit test #[Group('phar-real')] builds or expects PHAR, runs in tmux
- Test sends multiple prompts, verifies ❯ and ◇ blocks in transcript
- TUI snapshots captured and dumped on failure
- Session artifacts created at CWD/.hatfield/sessions/ (not inside PHAR)
- messenger.sqlite created at CWD/.hatfield/messenger.sqlite
- Temp dir created in ./var/ and cleaned up after test
- No hardcoded dirname(__DIR__, N) paths remain in runtime/controller/process code
- PHAR < 20MB compressed
- castor check passes

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T17:49:28.833Z
- PHAR readiness scout recon completed (3 scouts). Key findings: no Box/PHAR tooling exists yet; Kernel/bin entrypoint/cache/log/config paths are the first PHAR blockers; runtime process abstraction exists but only SourceTreeExecutableLocator is wired; AgentProcessSupervisor and Castor run/log tasks still hardcode bin/console; Controller/TUI E2E tests hardcode bin/console and should use a PHAR built to a stable /tmp/bin path. Scout artifact: /home/ineersa/.pi/agent/tmp/2026-06--3741ac4e.txt

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T18:41:13.395Z
- Design decision captured before implementation: PHAR/source app root must be treated as read-only/install root. Runtime writable paths should resolve from the runtime cwd, not kernel.project_dir. Defaults should use existing project-local Hatfield runtime tree: logs at <cwd>/.hatfield/logs, cache at <cwd>/.hatfield/cache, tmp at <cwd>/.hatfield/tmp as needed. Optional env overrides may exist for unusual deployments, but should be resolved relative to runtime cwd when relative and should not be required. This avoids PHAR/source-tree contamination and aligns tests/runs around isolated cwd behavior.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T18:43:06.454Z
- Open PHAR design questions resolved: build output should be the stable PHAR file `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar` for now, leaving an unqualified `/tmp/bin/hatfield` wrapper/binary name available later. Writable directory override env vars should use the Hatfield namespace (`HATFIELD_LOG_DIR`, `HATFIELD_CACHE_DIR`, and analogous names if tmp/session overrides are needed), with relative override values resolved against runtime cwd. PHAR execution should be mandatory for CLI/controller/TUI subprocess tests and Castor run flows; pure in-process/unit tests may continue to run source code unless implementation discovers a strong reason to route them through PHAR too.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T18:43:54.659Z
- Moved TODO → IN-PROGRESS.
- Created branch task/phar-packaging.
- Created worktree /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging.
- Copied vendor directory into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging.
- Copied .vera index into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T18:48:18.541Z
- Task-start preparation complete. Loaded task-workflow/testing/castor skills, claimed task to branch `task/phar-packaging` with worktree `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging`, reread the task, and launched focused scout prep in the worktree. Additional scout artifact: `/home/ineersa/.pi/agent/tmp/2026-06--5a82d8af.txt`. Fork implementation instructions will use resolved decisions: `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`, HATFIELD_* writable-dir env overrides, runtime-cwd `.hatfield/logs` and `.hatfield/cache`, and mandatory PHAR use for CLI/controller/TUI subprocess flows.

- Recorded fork run: 8nxese4ug8s1
- Implementation fork launched in worktree `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` as run `8nxese4ug8s1`. Fork instructions cover Box config, runtime-cwd writable dirs, PHAR executable locator/wiring, Castor `phar:build`/`phar:ensure`, mandatory PHAR usage for Castor run/controller/TUI subprocess tests, focused validation, and commit requirements.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T19:44:03.399Z
- Validation: Fork 8nxese4ug8s1 reported: php -l passed on changed files; box compile produced ~14.65MB PHAR with ~9153 files; `php /tmp/bin/hatfield.phar list` failed with ContainerBuilder missing service error; castor phpstan/cs-check/test not run.
- Summary: Fork `8nxese4ug8s1` completed partial implementation and committed `11680c1b` (`Implement PHAR packaging flow`). Scope implemented: box.json, runtime-cwd cache/log dirs, PHAR/config/source executable locators, Castor phar tasks, Castor run/test PHAR wiring, test executable helper, and PHAR smoke test. Current blockers: `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar` build takes about 3+ minutes and PHAR smoke boot currently fails/stale build reports Symfony service-not-found for `ConfiguredSymfonyAiPlatformFactory`; build-time optimization is now the priority before continuing boot/debug work. Researcher found likely causes/speedups: current config includes all `vendor/` (about 9k files), Box config `exclude-dev-files` alone did not prevent dev packages in copied vendor from being included, and fastest path is to use Box finder/exclusion or prepare a production vendor/staging build so dev packages (phpstan/phpunit/cs-fixer/deptrac/jetbrains stubs) are excluded, plus disable optional slow features where safe (`dump-autoload`, `check-requirements`, no compactors, possibly dev/no-compression mode).

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T20:00:21.882Z
- Recorded fork run: 35m0818sv7jc
- Continuation fork launched as `35m0818sv7jc` in `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` to optimize PHAR build time before further boot debugging. Instructions: implement `/tmp` production staging build, run Composer `--no-dev` in staging, run Box from staging, add valid Box speed options, preserve `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`, report timings/file counts/vendor exclusions, and commit changes.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T20:07:39.640Z
- Recorded fork run: 35m0818sv7jc
- Validation: Verified worktree log contains `66f45aeb Optimize PHAR build with production staging`; worktree status clean.; Verified commit stat: 2 files changed, 176 insertions, 16 deletions (`.castor/helpers.php`, `box.json`).; Fork validation reported: `php -l .castor/helpers.php` OK; helper runtime require OK; `castor phar:clean` OK; `castor phar:build` OK in ~33.7s; `castor phar:ensure` fresh path instant; stale detection triggered after touching `Kernel.php` and `box.json`; staged/PHAR vendor excludes dev packages; PHAR `list` boot smoke fails with separate `SessionRunStore` service-not-found error.
- Summary: Continuation fork `35m0818sv7jc` completed and committed `66f45aeb` (`Optimize PHAR build with production staging`). Build-time optimization is complete: `castor phar:build` now stages packaging input under `/tmp/hatfield-phar-build/source`, installs production Composer dependencies with `--no-dev`, runs Box from staging, keeps output `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`, adds Box speed options (`dump-autoload:false`, `check-requirements:false`), and adds mtime-based `phar:ensure` stale detection. Reported result: build time ~33.7s total (copy 0.0s, composer 1.2s, Box 32.5s), PHAR 5.9MB GZ, 5,146 files, dev packages excluded. Worktree verified clean after commit; latest commit changes `.castor/helpers.php` and `box.json` only. Remaining blocker: PHAR boot still fails separately with Symfony DI service error for `Ineersa\CodingAgent\Session\SessionRunStore`; next implementation should focus on PHAR boot/container compilation, not build speed.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T20:15:10.042Z
- Additional PHAR env design decision: do not bundle `.env`; Kernel-level `APP_ENV`/`APP_DEBUG` must come from the process environment before Hatfield settings load. The PHAR artifact is built from production dependencies (`composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` in staging), but runtime env should remain overridable: default `APP_ENV` can be `prod` when unset, while tests/Castor may set `APP_ENV=test` where appropriate; `APP_DEBUG` should not be forcibly disabled because it is useful for exception traces during Castor/test debugging. Hatfield settings continue to own app-level logging/model behavior, not Kernel environment selection.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T20:16:21.724Z
- Recorded fork run: 0w078vuuyvan
- Continuation fork launched as `0w078vuuyvan` in `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` to adjust PHAR build/runtime env and debug boot. Instructions: remove `--classmap-authoritative`, preserve caller-controlled `APP_ENV`/`APP_DEBUG` with optional PHAR default `APP_ENV=prod`, do not bundle `.env`, rebuild via Castor, investigate the `SessionRunStore` missing service root cause, implement minimal robust boot fix, validate PHAR `list`, and commit changes.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T20:43:59.033Z
- Recorded fork run: 0w078vuuyvan
- Validation: Verified commit exists: `8a919674 Fix PHAR boot: resource path wildcards, APP_ENV/autoloader fixes`.; Verified worktree status clean after fork commit.; Verified commit stat: 3 files changed, 17 insertions, 9 deletions (`.castor/helpers.php`, `bin/console`, `config/services.yaml`).; Fork validation reported: `php -l .castor/helpers.php` OK; helper require OK; `php -l bin/console` OK; full PHAR build via helper OK (~33.6s, 5.9MB); `php /tmp/bin/hatfield.phar list` OK with all commands listed including `agent`; `php /tmp/bin/hatfield.phar about` OK (`Environment: prod`, `Debug: false`); `castor phar:build` OK; `castor phar:ensure` fresh path OK (~7ms).; Fork intentionally did not run full `castor check` or E2E tests; `APP_ENV=test` PHAR execution fails as expected because test-only bundle/dependencies are absent from production vendor.
- Summary: Continuation fork `0w078vuuyvan` completed and committed `8a919674` (`Fix PHAR boot: resource path wildcards, APP_ENV/autoloader fixes`). PHAR now boots successfully. Root causes fixed: Symfony DI `resource:` imports using bare directory paths do not register services reliably inside `phar://`, so `config/services.yaml` resource/exclude paths were changed to `%kernel.project_dir%/.../**/*.php` wildcard patterns; `bin/console` now defaults unset `APP_ENV` to `prod`; staging Composer install removed `--classmap-authoritative` and build/smoke commands set default `APP_ENV=prod` while preserving caller-controlled `APP_DEBUG`. Verified worktree clean after commit. Latest commit changes `.castor/helpers.php`, `bin/console`, and `config/services.yaml` with 17 insertions / 9 deletions. Remaining work before PR: run selected Castor validation/reviewer in the next task-to-pr phase per workflow; no full validation was run during implementation phase.

- Recorded fork run: 87swgqa7p0ti
- Validation/fix fork launched as `87swgqa7p0ti` in `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` to verify PHAR subprocess test behavior and Castor validation. Instructions: inspect PHAR test/Castor wiring; verify tests execute `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar` from isolated `var/tmp/test-*` cwd; verify `.hatfield/settings.yaml`, logs/cache/tmp/session artifacts are created under isolated cwd; run Castor-focused validation and full `castor check` if prerequisites are available; implement/commit minimal fixes only if PHAR/test isolation issues are found; do not push, PR, move tasks, or run reviewer.

Full `castor check` was not run during implementation phase.
- Summary: Validation/fix fork `87swgqa7p0ti` completed and committed `ed576ce3` (`Fix PHAR runtime compatibility: migrations path, Process class, theme glob`). The fork reports PHAR runtime compatibility is now fixed beyond boot: Doctrine migrations are extracted from the PHAR to `/tmp/hatfield-phar-runtime/migrations/` and wired through `HATFIELD_MIGRATIONS_DIR`; `symfony/process` moved into production `require` because runtime consumers need it; TUI theme loading now uses `scandir()` instead of `glob()` for `phar://` compatibility. Verified commit exists and worktree is clean. Latest commit changes 5 files (`bin/console`, `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `config/packages/doctrine_migrations.yaml`, `src/Tui/Theme/ThemeRegistry.php`) with 125 insertions / 71 deletions. Fork reports PHAR now boots, migrations/themes/consumer process runtime issues are fixed, and controller E2E boots the PHAR; remaining controller/TUI/LLM-real test instability was reported as pre-existing and not fully resolved in this implementation phase. Full `castor check` was not run in this phase.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T21:19:43.837Z
- Read-only scout completed for replacing DoctrineMigrationsBundle/PHAR migration extraction with an app-owned startup migrator. Findings: only migration file is `migrations/Version20260601152619.php`, creating `hatfield_session`, `background_process`, and `tool_batch_state` plus unique index `(run_id, turn_no, step_id)`; DoctrineMigrationsBundle is only used by `StartupDatabaseMigrator` via `doctrine_migrations.migrate_command` and by Castor test bootstrap; runtime entry point is already `AgentCommand` before controller/headless/TUI starts, while messenger consumers rely on AgentCommand running migrations before launch; current PHAR workaround is `bin/console` extracting migrations to `/tmp/hatfield-phar-runtime/migrations/` and `doctrine_migrations.yaml` reading `HATFIELD_MIGRATIONS_DIR`; likely replacement touches `StartupDatabaseMigrator`, `services.yaml`, `.castor/tasks.php`, removes DoctrineMigrationsBundle config/bundle registration and PHAR extraction block, and can delete the `migrations/` filesystem dependency.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T21:23:51.525Z
- Recorded fork run: rl2qcti5mdwt
- Implementation fork launched as `rl2qcti5mdwt` in `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` to replace DoctrineMigrationsBundle/filesystem migrations with an app-owned custom startup migrator. Instructions: remove PHAR migrations extraction and `HATFIELD_MIGRATIONS_DIR`, replace `StartupDatabaseMigrator` with idempotent DBAL/schema logic equivalent to `Version20260601152619.php`, update Castor test bootstrap to use app migrator path/command instead of `doctrine:migrations:migrate`, remove unused Doctrine migrations bundle/config/files/dependencies, rebuild/smoke PHAR, run focused Castor validation (`castor test`, phpstan, deptrac, cs-check, phar build/ensure), and commit changes.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T21:27:45.958Z
- Implementation fork `rl2qcti5mdwt` was manually interrupted/stopped after user raised a design question about preserving migration versions/generation before removing DoctrineMigrationsBundle. The fork had started running validation/build commands; no fork result/commit has been accepted yet. Next action should revise the migration strategy before launching another implementation fork.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-04T21:28:35.281Z
- Recorded fork run: rl2qcti5mdwt
- Validation: Fork `rl2qcti5mdwt` reported failed: `Fork terminated before producing result.json [pid_died]`.
- Summary: Fork `rl2qcti5mdwt` failed/terminated before producing result.json because the parent manually stopped it after the migration design question. No result was accepted and no commit from that fork should be relied on. Revised design direction: do not remove migration generation/versioning tooling blindly. Prefer keeping DoctrineMigrationsBundle as dev/test tooling for diff/generate workflows while replacing PHAR/runtime migration execution with an app-owned migrator that has its own version table and does not require filesystem scanning/extraction in the PHAR.

- Recorded fork run: gql9ozouj7u4
- Recovery/implementation fork launched as `gql9ozouj7u4` in `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` after killed fork left dirty changes. Corrected scope: keep Doctrine migrations system/tooling/versioning/generation (bundle/config/migration classes/deps) but remove runtime startup dependency on the Symfony `doctrine:migrations:migrate` command. Fork instructions: inspect and clean dirty state from killed fork; restore migration files/config/bundle as needed; implement custom `StartupDatabaseMigrator` path using known migration classes and standard `doctrine_migration_versions` table without PHAR filesystem scanning/extraction; remove PHAR migration extraction and `HATFIELD_MIGRATIONS_DIR` if no longer needed; preserve existing PHAR build/boot/runtime fixes; run focused Castor validation and commit.

- Summary: Recovery/implementation fork `gql9ozouj7u4` completed and committed `144daa85` (`Run startup migrations without console command`). Corrected migration design is implemented: Doctrine migrations system/tooling remains in the project, but runtime startup no longer invokes the Symfony `doctrine:migrations:migrate` console command. New `ApplicationMigrationExecutor` applies known migration classes directly via DBAL and records versions in the standard `doctrine_migration_versions` table, avoiding PHAR filesystem migration extraction. PHAR migration extraction and `HATFIELD_MIGRATIONS_DIR` were removed from `bin/console`; `doctrine_migrations.yaml` restored to `%kernel.project_dir%/migrations`; `DoctrineMigrations\` PSR-4 autoload added so migration classes are loadable inside the PHAR; `StartupDatabaseMigrator` now uses the executor. Fork also cleaned dirty state left by killed fork and preserved previous PHAR build/boot/runtime fixes. Verified latest commit exists and worktree is clean. Commit stat: 14 files changed, 361 insertions, 125 deletions. Remaining implementation-phase blocker: none reported; full `castor check` still deferred to task-to-pr phase/prerequisites.

- Validation/fix fork launched as `cdzgxch4oqnv` in `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/phar-packaging` to verify PHAR argv/env/cwd parameter propagation and run full `castor check`. Instructions: inspect Castor/test/runtime executable wiring, run focused PHAR argument/cwd smokes, verify `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar` is used instead of `bin/console`, verify `.hatfield` locations, run `castor check` with project-standard env/prerequisites, fix/commit task-caused issues if found, and report blockers if validation fails due to environment/pre-existing flakiness.

- Read-only comparison scout completed against `/home/ineersa/claw/castor` PHAR/runtime patterns. Key useful Castor patterns for later consideration: isolated `tools/phar` Box toolchain, fixed Composer autoloader suffix during PHAR build, immediate PHAR smoke tests after compile, project/root vs runtime cwd split, explicit PHAR/static installation detection, and simple source-constant versioning. Scout also flagged potential agent-core review items: no autoloader suffix handling, Box config lacks compactor/annotations/blacklist and keeps composer files, output path hardcoded to `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`, and migration executor has a reflection maintenance risk. Parent analysis notes some scout recommendations need review before implementation: compactor may slow builds (user cares about build time), `dump-autoload:false` is intentional with staging Composer optimized autoload and does not regenerate at runtime, broad blacklist patterns may be unsafe/ineffective in Box 4, and `phar://` resource paths are expected rather than automatically wrong.

- Summary: Validation/fix fork `cdzgxch4oqnv` completed and committed `f74d6402` (`Fix PHAR subprocess spawning and migration Query type handling`). It found and fixed two PHAR/runtime bugs: `PharExecutableLocator` now falls back to `__FILE__`/`new Phar(__FILE__)->getPath()` because Box 4.x PHARs can make `Phar::running(false)` return empty, preventing PHAR subprocesses from resolving the physical `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`; `ApplicationMigrationExecutor` now handles Doctrine Migrations 3.9 `Query` objects in `AbstractMigration::$plannedSql` via `getStatement()` in addition to the older array format. Fork verified argv/env/cwd propagation: Castor run/test flows and subprocess tests wire `HATFIELD_BINARY_PATH=/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`; `agent --cwd=<dir>` works and creates isolated `.hatfield/cache` in the target dir; `--cwd` is only a command option on `agent`, so `hatfield.phar --cwd=<dir> about` is rejected by Symfony Console after early chdir, which is cosmetic for non-agent commands. Verified latest commit exists and worktree is clean. Commit stat: 2 files changed, 36 insertions, 8 deletions. Full `castor check` still does not pass cleanly due to reported pre-existing blockers: llm-real `ViewImageToolE2eTest` flakiness and 8 phpstan style errors unrelated to PHAR changes.

- Recorded fork run: 6og1g4rk2idz
- Launched implementation fork `6og1g4rk2idz` with model `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` to clean up PHAR packaging architecture. Scope: centralize PHAR paths/config, add deterministic staging-only Composer autoloader suffix, evaluate optional `tools/phar` Box toolchain isolation, strengthen post-build smoke validation against actual artifact from isolated cwd, apply only low-risk Box config hygiene, preserve build speed (~<45s), keep runtime startup migrator/no extraction, avoid irrelevant Castor static/repack patterns, commit changes, and run focused Castor validation without full `castor check`.

- Summary: Implementation fork `6og1g4rk2idz` completed and committed `1a0dc5b2` (`Clean up PHAR packaging architecture`). Verified commit exists and worktree is clean. Architectural changes: centralized PHAR path/staging/tool resolution in `.castor/helpers.php` with defaults `/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar` and `/tmp/hatfield-phar-build/source` plus env overrides; added deterministic staging-only Composer autoloader suffix `HatfieldPharBuild`; isolated Box toolchain under `tools/phar/` with lazy install fallback; added post-build PHAR smokes from isolated temp cwd validating `list`, `about`, `agent --help`, and `.hatfield/cache` creation; added low-risk Box setting `annotations:false`; kept `exclude-composer-files:false` because Box 4 strips root `composer.json` even when explicitly listed, breaking Symfony `getProjectDir()`/`bundles.php`; kept `dump-autoload:false`, no compactors, no broad blacklist, no static/repack features, no migration extraction.

- Recorded fork run: ohpro44msdnz
- Final reviewer returned APPROVED after cleanup commit `3533f2b1`, but local task-to-pr validation found `castor phpstan` failing with 9 file errors in changed branch files (`.castor/helpers.php`, `ChainExecutableLocator.php`, `ConfigExecutableLocator.php`) while `castor test`, `castor deptrac`, and `castor cs-check` passed. Launched implementation fork `ohpro44msdnz` with model `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` to fix the phpstan issues cleanly without behavior changes, run `castor phpstan`/`castor cs-check` and `castor test` if practical, and commit.

- Summary: Implementation fork `ohpro44msdnz` completed and committed `9815b6fe` (`Fix PHPStan errors: short ternaries, dynamic method, always-false condition`). Verified commit exists and worktree is clean. It fixed all 9 local `castor phpstan` file errors without intended behavior changes: reshaped short ternaries in `.castor/helpers.php` and `ConfigExecutableLocator`, added `clearstatcache()` after lazy Box toolchain install so PHPStan accepts the second executable check, removed unnecessary null-coalesce on guaranteed non-null Composer output, and replaced `ChainExecutableLocator` dynamic method dispatch with explicit `match` calls.

- Recorded fork run: aur5mngapkz1
- Final re-review after `9815b6fe` returned APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS with no blockers and stated task can proceed to CODE-REVIEW. To pursue a clean APPROVED result, launched small implementation fork `aur5mngapkz1` with model `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` to address the one sensible actionable naming suggestion: rename misleading `$schemaBefore` in `ApplicationMigrationExecutor` to reflect the potentially-mutated migration schema after `up()`. Style-only/global function qualification and double-guard suggestions were scoped out unless the fork finds a real correctness issue.

- Summary: Implementation fork `aur5mngapkz1` completed and committed `cb131fc9` (rename `$schemaBefore` to `$migrationSchema` in `ApplicationMigrationExecutor`). Verified commit exists and worktree is clean. Change is a pure variable rename in `src/CodingAgent/Migrations/ApplicationMigrationExecutor.php`, addressing the final reviewer naming suggestion that the schema object is potentially mutated after `up()`, so `$schemaBefore` was misleading. Commit stat: 1 file changed, 3 insertions, 3 deletions. Style-only suggestions about global function qualification and double guards were intentionally skipped as non-actionable/no correctness issue.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-05T00:26:14.748Z
- Validation: Reviewer: APPROVED on current HEAD `cb131fc9`; no critical issues, no issues, no security notes; task can proceed to CODE-REVIEW.; `castor test`: OK. Rebuilt stale PHAR first (`/tmp/bin/hatfield.phar`, 5.9MB, timings copy=0.0s composer=1.4s box=1.3s total=2.8s); PHAR smokes OK (`list`, `about`, `agent --help`, writable-dir isolation); PHPUnit OK (1660 tests, 4907 assertions, 0 errors, 0 failures, 0 skipped).; `castor deptrac`: OK (violations=0, errors=0, uncovered=618, allowed=818).; `castor phpstan`: OK (errors=0, file_errors=0).; `castor cs-check`: OK (files_fixed=0).
- Summary: Final reviewer subagent decision on current HEAD `cb131fc9`: APPROVED — no blockers; task can proceed to CODE-REVIEW. Reviewer verified the final rename commit and broader PHAR changeset, with only cosmetic non-blocking notes (commit subject typo and harmless `$resolved` scope note). Local task-to-pr validation completed successfully after final HEAD.
