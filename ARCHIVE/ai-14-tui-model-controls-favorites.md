# AI-14 TUI model controls and favorites

## Goal
Plan reference: .pi/plans/symfony_ai_platform_integration_plan.md#ai-14--tui-model-controls-and-favorites

Goal: add user controls for switching models/reasoning from the TUI.

Depends on: AI-07, AI-08, AI-13.

Parallelism: final UI task after selection, runtime input, and footer projection exist.

Scope:
- `/model` overlay/list: favorites first, all configured provider models after favorites, scrollable, `Ctrl+F` toggles favorite, `Enter` selects.
- `Ctrl+P` cycles favorite models.
- `Shift+Tab` cycles reasoning levels: `off -> minimal -> low -> medium -> high -> xhigh -> off`.
- Persist model/reasoning changes through selection services.
- Emit/update runtime events so footer changes immediately.

## Acceptance criteria
- User can select a model before the next turn.
- Favorite cycling only cycles configured/favorited models.
- Reasoning cycle updates session/home defaults and footer state.
- Existing TUI snapshots are updated only if rendering intentionally changes.
- Suggested validation: `castor test --filter Tui`; `castor test:tui`.

- Summary: AI-14 fork completed at commit 03735c79. Implemented /model command via slash registry, Ctrl+P favorite cycling, Shift+Tab reasoning cycling, favorite_models parsing/persistence, footer state updates, and tests. Fork notes deviations/open risks: no interactive overlay/Ctrl+F/Enter picker; uses /model fav/select commands instead; favorites persisted to disk but in-memory AiConfig may be stale until restart; no runtime events emitted beyond direct TuiSessionState footer update.

- Validation: vendor/bin/phpunit tests/CodingAgent/Config/ModelSelectionServiceTest.php — 40 tests, 92 assertions, OK; vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Tui/Listener/ModelCommandHandlerTest.php — 18 tests, 49 assertions, OK; ~/.local/bin/castor test — 509 tests, 8453 assertions, OK (1 pre-existing notice); ~/.local/bin/castor deptrac — 0 violations; ~/.local/bin/castor phpstan — 0 errors; ~/.local/bin/castor cs-check — clean
- Summary: Follow-up fork applied review fixes on commit 3d5bca5d:
1) Fixed stale favorite state: added in-process $favRaw cache so toggleFavorite() is immediately visible to getFavoriteModels/isFavorite/getOrderedModels/cycleFavoriteModel without AppConfig rebuild.
2) Added 7 tests in ModelSelectionServiceTest (add/remove immediate visibility) + 3 tests in ModelCommandHandlerTest (fav list, star, add-remove immediacy).
3) Made ModelControlListener::register() idempotent with has()/setHandler() pattern.
4) Documented ai.favorite_models in .hatfield/settings.yaml and docs/settings.md.
Validation: 509 tests pass, 8453 assertions, 0 deptrac violations, 0 phpstan errors, cs-check clean.
- Applied review follow-up fixes: favorite in-process cache, immediate visibility tests, idempotent listener registration, settings docs. Commit 3d5bca5d.

- Moved CODE-REVIEW → IN-PROGRESS.
- Summary: Moved back from code review based on user smoke-test feedback: remove reasoning text from footer; Shift+Tab reasoning changes should update a symbol before the model and model-name color using theme colors per reasoning level; model selection did not persist across restart; /model must present an actual selectable list using Symfony TUI list/widget capabilities; list must support Ctrl+F favorite toggle while cycling/navigating.

- Summary: AI-14 smoke-test follow-up completed at commit 7b719773. Fixed footer reasoning presentation with dedicated ThemeColor::Thinking* colors applied to both symbol and model name, removed project-level default_model/default_reasoning override so home model selection persists across restart, added interactive /model picker backed by Symfony TUI SelectListWidget, and added Ctrl+F favorite toggle while navigating the picker. Known open decisions: whether to make Ctrl+P/Shift+Tab listener registration idempotent too, and whether explicit focus restore to editor is needed after closing picker.

- Summary: AI-14 ready for re-review after smoke-test fixes at commit 7b719773. Added interactive /model picker using Symfony TUI SelectListWidget, Ctrl+F favorite toggle while navigating, Enter select/Escape cancel, dedicated reasoning theme colors for footer symbol and model name, and fixed persistence by removing project-level default_model/default_reasoning override so home settings can persist choices across restart. Note: picker is mounted dynamically as a Symfony TUI widget rather than a full modal overlay; RTVS tasks still own real runtime transcript projection.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-18T22:59:33.111Z
- Moved CODE-REVIEW → IN-PROGRESS.
- Summary: User smoke-tested updated PR and found remaining issues: footer still shows textual reasoning/model status, reasoning hotkey cycles levels for models without thinking support (e.g. llama.cpp), and favorite selection UX should be separate `/model fav` picker using Space to toggle favorites and Enter to submit. Moving back to IN-PROGRESS for fixes.

- Summary: AI-14 smoke-test fixes applied at commit 9d56de59 on task/ai-14-tui-model-controls-favorites:
1. Removed persistent "Reasoning:" / "Model:" status entries from footer/status panel; footer uses ThemeColor::Thinking* colors only
2. Added supports_thinking_levels provider config flag (default true), parsed in AiProviderConfig, with HatfieldModelCatalog::supportsThinkingLevels() method
3. ModelSelectionService::cycleReasoningForCurrentModel() guards against unsupported models (llama_cpp with reasoning:false or supports_thinking_levels:false); Shift+Tab listener uses this, no-ops silently
4. /model fav (no args) opens interactive FavoritePickerController (SelectListWidget) with * markers, Space to toggle favorites, Enter to close; textual fallback retained
5. .hatfield/settings.yaml sets llama_cpp supports_thinking_levels: false; config defaults and docs/settings.md updated
6. 6 new tests for thinking-levels guard; 528 non-e2e tests pass; 0 deptrac; 0 phpstan; CS clean. Pre-existing TUI e2e failures unchanged.

- Summary: AI-14 smoke-test follow-up complete at commit 9d56de59. Fixed footer/status clutter by removing persistent Reasoning:/Model: status entries; footer now uses ThemeColor::Thinking* color only on symbol/model. Added provider-level supports_thinking_levels (llama_cpp false) plus model.reasoning guard so Shift+Tab is no-op for unsupported current models. Added /model fav interactive favorites picker using Symfony TUI SelectListWidget with * markers, Space toggle, Enter close/submit, and retained /model fav <ref> textual fallback. Updated docs/settings.md, .hatfield/settings.yaml, and config defaults.

- Summary: User smoke-tested commit 9d56de59 and found UX issues: switching to non-thinking model (llama) after thinking model doesn't reset footer color; /help lacks useful /model fav description; model/favorite lists need themed header/instructions; current/selected rows should use theme styling/color/background rather than plain markers only; favorites list needs explicit instructions (Space toggle, Enter save). Moving back to IN-PROGRESS for UX polish.

- Summary: AI-14 UX polish complete at commit 47bd30bf. Fixed stale footer thinking color by adding display-safe reasoning that returns off for non-thinking models and using it for /model select, picker selection, and Ctrl+P favorite cycling. Improved /model help metadata for picker and favorites UX. Added instructional headers above model and favorites pickers using Symfony TUI ContainerWidget/TextWidget around SelectListWidget. Current model is marked with description metadata, favorites use * markers, and selected rows rely on SelectListWidget default bold styling. Picker close lifecycle now removes container wrappers cleanly.

- Summary: User smoke-tested commit 47bd30bf and requested additional UX/config fixes: z.ai models have no xhigh so remove xhigh from z.ai settings/maps; picker headers should be styled nicer (muted/theme color); list rows still appear white/blended, so use theme palette/colors to visibly mark favorites/current/selection; remove ugly 'current' description word; keep * favorite marker in list but do not use it inconsistently in header.

- Summary: AI-14 picker UX/config follow-up complete at commit 3e091136. Removed xhigh from z.ai settings/defaults/docs and made reasoning cycling per-model via thinking_level_map keys + off, so z.ai no longer exposes xhigh while DeepSeek keeps it. Styled picker headers with muted theme color, colored current/favorite markers using ThemeColor Accent/Warning, removed textual current description, and cleaned favorites header wording. Added ChatScreen::theme() to pass runtime theme into picker label/header rendering.

- Summary: Reviewer subagent completed AI-14 PR #27 review at head 3e091136. Verdict: APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS. No critical issues, no wheel reinvention detected, Symfony TUI reuse deemed appropriate (SelectListWidget, ContainerWidget, TextWidget, Keybindings, events/lifecycle). SOLID/architecture boundaries acceptable with clear separation of ModelSelectionService, picker controllers, command handler, and footer provider. Findings: duplicate lookupContextWindow logic in ModelPickerController/ModelControlListener/ModelCommandHandler; test bug in ModelPickerControllerTest where trim() masks non-favorite marker assertion; HomeSettingsWriter regex comment overwrite risk; stale comment in ModelPickerController referencing removed current description; unused $pickerController variable in ModelControlListener; optional docblock for public closure callback methods.

- Summary: AI-14 reviewer suggestions addressed at commit 3324fa1d. Deduplicated context-window lookup into FooterStateInitializer::resolveContextWindowForRef() and updated picker, Ctrl+P, and textual /model select paths. Fixed non-favorite marker test to assert raw label marker. Updated stale ModelPickerController comment and added @internal notes for public callback methods. Removed unused ModelControlListener variable. Hardened HomeSettingsWriter so writeAiKey/writeAiListKey only replace active keys and preserve commented-out user settings, with added favorite_models write tests.
