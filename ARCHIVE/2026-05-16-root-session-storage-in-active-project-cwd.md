# Root session storage in active project cwd

## Goal
Session persistence should use the user project cwd/session config, not the app install root or Symfony kernel.project_dir. Review HatfieldSessionStore, SessionRunStore, SessionRunEventStore, and runtime wiring so .hatfield/sessions lives under the target project unless settings override it.

## Acceptance criteria
- SessionRunStore and SessionRunEventStore no longer implicitly write to app install root for TUI/headless runs.
- The active project cwd is passed through runtime/session boundaries explicitly enough to support PHAR distribution.
- HatfieldSessionStore and AgentCore stores agree on the same session directory for a run.
- Resume flow still works with session_id === run_id.
- Relevant session-storage docs/tests are updated.
- castor check passes.

- Summary: Fork cozv1blzbi34 completed implementation. Commit `8fe3738f8af89dba3a60402395575af86a3ac71c` on task branch makes session storage use active project cwd/session config by adding sessions-base-path initialization through `AgentSessionClient`, propagating it from `InteractiveMode` to in-process AgentCore stores, exposing `HatfieldSessionStore::resolveSessionsBasePath()`, and updating docs/tests. Process transport currently has a no-op/TODO for passing sessions path to subprocess, documented as follow-up.
