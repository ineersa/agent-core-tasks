# EDITOR-11 Shell command prefix !

## Goal
Plan: .pi/plans/editor_rollout_plan.md

MVP: yes — deliberately small.

Implement a single editor submission prefix:

```text
!<command>
```

Submitting `!<command>` executes the command through the existing bash/tool/runtime path and shows the result in the transcript. It is a terminal convenience feature only: output is **not** added to the model context and submitting a shell command must **not** trigger an LLM turn.

This task supersedes the original `!`/`!!` context-vs-hidden split. The user explicitly chose simplicity because this feature is rarely used.

## Final product semantics

### Supported
- `!echo hello` runs bash command `echo hello`.
- The command and its output appear in the TUI transcript/status/tool block stream using existing runtime projection primitives where practical.
- Shell command execution does not call the LLM.
- Shell command output is not appended to `RunState::messages`, prompt context, user context, tool-role model history, or any other LLM-visible state.
- The first submitted input may be a shell command. This must create/use whatever runtime session state is needed to display/persist transcript output, but it must remain a shell-only action and must not invoke the model.
- If a normal agent turn is already working, submitted shell commands must queue/serialize through runtime command handling. Do not execute them directly in TUI and do not interleave concurrent shell output with the active turn.

### Not supported in this task
- `!!` execution is intentionally out of scope.
- No hidden/context mode split.
- No shell output injection into model context.
- No follow-up LLM turn after shell execution.
- No command history/search, shell completion, piping UI, or interactive shell session.

If the current parser still recognizes `!!`, implementation should make `!!` a clear local unsupported-command path (for example: “`!!` is not supported; use `!`”) and must not execute it. It is also acceptable to simplify parser/tests so only single-`!` shell commands are recognized, as long as `!!` is not silently executed.

## Existing code facts

Known current state before implementation:
- `src/Tui/Command/CommandParser.php` already has shell-prefix parsing support.
- `src/Tui/Command/ShellCommand.php` exists and currently models a command plus a hidden/context-related flag from the old `!`/`!!` design.
- `src/Tui/Command/SubmissionRouter.php` currently routes `ShellCommand` to a “not yet supported” local message/stub.
- `src/Tui/Command` has strict Deptrac boundaries and must remain pure TUI command parsing/routing code.
- TUI code must talk to runtime only through `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Contract`, `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Protocol`, and `AgentSessionClient`.

## Implementation direction

Prefer the smallest runtime-backed path that preserves boundaries:

1. **Parser / command DTO cleanup**
   - Keep `!<command>` parsing.
   - Reject empty commands (`!` or `!   `) with a local validation message.
   - Remove or ignore the old hidden/context flag for runtime behavior.
   - Ensure `!!` does not execute.

2. **Submission routing**
   - Replace the current shell-command stub in `SubmissionRouter` with a typed routing result, e.g. `DispatchShellCommand`.
   - The routed payload should include only:
     - command string
     - original submitted text if useful for transcript display
   - Do not add model-context flags; there is only one mode and it is context-excluded.

3. **TUI listener boundary**
   - Update submit handling (likely `SubmitListener`) to send a runtime command through `AgentSessionClient` rather than executing bash in TUI.
   - TUI must not import `AgentCore`, Messenger, BashTool, Symfony Process, or tool executor classes.

4. **Runtime contract/protocol**
   - Add a typed runtime/user command for shell execution, e.g. `shell_command`.
   - Update both runtime transports:
     - in-process client
     - JSONL/headless process client
   - Keep payload explicit and small: command text plus correlation/session metadata already used by runtime.

5. **Runtime/app execution**
   - Execute through the shared bash/tool path so existing bash semantics are reused:
     - cancellation where available
     - timeout/background behavior where available
     - approval/safety hooks where available
     - existing tool result formatting
   - Do not implement a second process runner in TUI or a parallel ad-hoc `proc_open`/`Process` path for this feature.
   - If a direct tool executor call is used, create a synthetic bash `ToolCall` in the app/runtime layer, not in `src/Tui`.

6. **Transcript projection**
   - Prefer emitting/reusing existing runtime/tool projection events so the transcript shows a normal tool-like block for bash.
   - Do not render shell output with one-off ad-hoc TUI strings except for local validation errors such as an empty command or unsupported `!!`.
   - Persist/replay shell transcript output consistently with existing session event/transcript mechanisms.

7. **Queueing / serialization**
   - While an agent turn is working, shell commands should be queued/serialized through runtime command handling.
   - Do not run shell commands in parallel from the focused editor listener.
   - Avoid transcript interleaving between an active LLM/tool turn and a submitted shell command.

## Likely files affected

This list is intentionally concrete for the implementor, but exact names may change after exploration:

- `src/Tui/Command/CommandParser.php`
- `src/Tui/Command/ShellCommand.php`
- `src/Tui/Command/SubmissionRouter.php`
- possible new `src/Tui/Command/DispatchShellCommand.php`
- `src/Tui/Listener/SubmitListener.php`
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Contract/UserCommand.php`
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Contract/AgentSessionClient.php` only if the existing `send()` shape is insufficient
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/InProcess/InProcessAgentSessionClient.php`
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Process/JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient.php`
- runtime protocol/controller command handling under `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Protocol/` and `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Controller/`
- app/runtime command handler that bridges shell command requests to the shared bash tool executor
- transcript/runtime projection code only if existing tool projection events cannot already represent the command output
- matching tests under `tests/Tui/`, `tests/CodingAgent/Runtime/`, and any AgentCore/app handler tests needed for context-exclusion

## Acceptance criteria

- `!echo hello` submitted from the editor runs the shared bash/tool execution path and displays `hello` in the transcript/tool output.
- Shell output is not included in model context and does not affect the next LLM prompt.
- Submitting `!echo hello` as the first input works without invoking the model.
- Submitting `!` or blank shell command produces a clear local validation message and does not execute anything.
- `!!` is not executed; it is either no longer parsed as a shell command or produces a clear unsupported-command message.
- Shell commands submitted while the agent is working are queued/serialized through runtime command handling, not run directly in parallel by TUI.
- TUI layer remains behind `AgentSessionClient` / runtime contract/protocol boundaries; Deptrac stays green.
- Tests cover parser/routing behavior, runtime command transport, successful command execution, no-LLM/no-context behavior, and unsupported/empty command behavior.
- At least one integration or TUI/runtime smoke test covers a successful shell command.

## Exclusions

- Do not implement bash process management here; reuse the existing BashTool/tool execution path.
- Do not bypass safety/approval hooks when they exist.
- Do not add shell output to model context.
- Do not implement `!!` semantics.
- Do not trigger an LLM turn after shell execution.
- Do not add external shell completion/history features.
- Do not add production APIs solely for tests.

Dependencies: EDITOR-03, EDITOR-05, TOOLS-09, RTVS-04, RTVS-07.
Parallelizable with: EDITOR-08, EDITOR-09, EDITOR-10 once dependencies allow.

## Validation

Use Castor only. Because this touches TUI/runtime/tool flow, full validation is required before CODE-REVIEW:

```bash
castor test --filter=CommandParser
castor test --filter=SubmissionRouter
castor test --filter=SubmitListener
castor test --filter=Shell
castor deptrac
castor phpstan
castor cs-check
LLM_MODE=true castor check
```

If prerequisites for `LLM_MODE=true castor check` are unavailable (tmux or llama.cpp test server on port 9052), the task must stay IN-PROGRESS with the blocker recorded.

- Summary: Implementation complete at commit a27b407d1f655b86125bbf609d4a7b2314d9105c on task/editor-11-shell-prefix-commands. Simplified EDITOR-11 MVP implemented: single `!<command>` prefix routes to DispatchShellCommand; `!!` is rejected/unsupported and never executes; shell execution goes through AgentSessionClient runtime boundary and shared ToolExecutorInterface/BashTool path; in-process and JSONL/headless paths support `shell_command`; shell output is projected through tool_execution events/transcript projection and does not trigger an LLM turn or add model context. Recovery fork also ported the two stray files from integration checkout into the task worktree and removed the stray files, leaving integration checkout clean. Worktree clean and ready for task-to-pr when requested.

- Recorded fork run: j9zu4yefhdip
- Summary: User smoke-tested commit a27b407d and found two regressions: TUI remains stuck at `◐ Running...` after shell command completion, and submitted `!<command>` entries are not included in prompt history. Launched fix fork j9zu4yefhdip to emit/propagate terminal events needed to clear working state and record shell submissions in the user transcript/history stream without adding shell output to model context or triggering an LLM turn.

This matches the known env-only PHAR smoke failure pattern, not an EDITOR-11 code failure.; Fork-reported validation before my check: focused shell/router/prompt-history tests passed; full suite/deptrac/phpstan passed in fork environment
- Summary: Smoke regression fix complete at commit b00a17de on task/editor-11-shell-prefix-commands. Fixes: standalone shell command now emits a terminal run.completed path via AgentSessionClient::completeRun()/AgentEnd so TUI clears `◐ Running...`; submitted `!<command>` is added as a user-message transcript block so prompt history Up/Down can recall it; `!!` remains unsupported and shell output still does not enter model context or trigger LLM. Fork noted one remaining task-scope risk: shell commands submitted during an already-active agent run are still sent immediately through runtime command handling and not explicitly queued to avoid interleaving.

- Recorded fork run: yj85jyfihoh1
- Summary: User smoke-tested b00a17de and reported the fixes do not work in real TUI: first-input `!ls` breaks/stalls the session so next message does nothing; after a normal first turn, second-turn `!ls` leaves `Working...`/`◐ Running...` stuck; prompt history still not fixed. Launched fork yj85jyfihoh1 with hard requirement to add real `TmuxHarness`/`TuiAgentSmokeTest` E2E coverage for these exact flows, reproduce before fixing, and only report success once `castor test:tui` proves the behavior.

Launched fork 5qvx1fcl3pvo to replace/fix the real TUI tests so they use `!ls -1` with a unique file in cwd whose name is not present in the submitted command, prove actual shell output, reproduce first-input and second-turn user failures, and fix root cause without speculative SafeGuard blame.

- Summary: Real TUI fix complete at commit aafac529 on task/editor-11-shell-prefix-commands. Corrected the previous false-positive TUI test by replacing `!printf <marker>` with `!ls -1` over a unique marker file created in the isolated cwd; marker filename is not present in submitted command, so its appearance proves actual command output. Root cause of missing first-input shell output in JSONL/TUI mode: shell-only runs bypassed normal start() and never emitted RunStarted, so RuntimeEventEmitter did not register a drain-loop cursor for the run and never forwarded canonical tool_exec/AgentEnd events to TUI. Fix: ShellCommandHandler emits a synthetic transient RunStarted(kind=shell) before executing shell command, registering the cursor; drain loop then forwards tool output and completion. Also added completeRun handling for terminal subsequent shell commands. E2E now covers first-input `!ls -1` output + next normal prompt, second-turn `!ls -1` output + working clear, prompt-history Up recall, and `!!` unsupported.

- Validation: Reviewer subagent: APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS, no blockers; Pre-review validation on aafac529 already passed: `castor test:tui` (9 tests, 23 assertions); `castor test --filter='Shell|PromptHistory|SubmissionRouter|CommandParser|ShellCommandHandler'` (79 tests, 171 assertions); `castor deptrac` (0 violations); `castor phpstan` (0 errors); `castor cs-check` clean
- Summary: Reviewer verdict for HEAD aafac529: APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS, no critical/bug/security blockers. Reviewer confirmed architecture is sound: `!` routes through BashTool/ToolExecutor, SafeGuard/tool hooks apply, TUI stays behind AgentSessionClient/runtime boundary, synthetic RunStarted + AgentEnd lifecycle correctly enables JSONL drain loop forwarding, and TUI E2E tests prove real `!ls -1` output via marker files not present in command text. Non-blocking suggestions: narrow edge case after failed first-input shell command with pre-populated request could silently drop follow-up prompt; `$cwd` payload/parameter is currently misleading/unused because BashTool resolves cwd from AppConfig; minor duplication/simplification opportunities; consider future unit test for InProcess shellExecute event sequence; minor stale comment wording in TickPollListener.

- Summary: Attempted move to CODE-REVIEW after reviewer approval, but Castor quality gate failed only in full `castor test` at `tests/CodingAgent/Phar/PharSmokeTest.php::testPharCacheIsolationUsesContentHash`. All other gate steps passed: deptrac 0 violations, controller E2E, llm-real, tui-e2e (9 tests/23 assertions), phpstan, cs-check. Failure cause: PHAR smoke command `APP_ENV=prod php var/tmp/phar/hatfield.phar list` in temp cwd inherited real user config with `ai.default_model=llama_cpp_test/test`, which is unavailable in prod packaged providers.

Change is test-only: `tests/CodingAgent/Phar/PharSmokeTest.php` now creates isolated empty HOME directories for PHAR subprocess calls and prefixes shell/Process commands with HOME=<isolated>, preventing real `~/.hatfield/settings.yaml` from leaking into APP_ENV=prod PHAR boot. This preserves PHAR boot/list/help/cache-isolation coverage while avoiding user-local `ai.default_model=llama_cpp_test/test` failures in packaged prod providers.
