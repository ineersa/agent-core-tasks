# RTVS-03 TranscriptProjector assistant and user stream support

## Goal
Plan: .pi/plans/runtime-transcript-vertical-slice-plan.md

Scope:
- Add TranscriptProjector under src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Projection.
- Consume ordered RuntimeEvent instances and maintain current transcript block state.
- Implement user.message_submitted -> UserMessage block.
- Implement assistant.message_started/text_started/text_delta/text_completed/thinking_started/thinking_delta/thinking_completed/message_completed/message_failed.
- Ensure projector can be replayed from the beginning to rebuild the same block list.

Exclusions:
- Do not implement tool/HITL/cancel handling; that is RTVS-04.
- Do not modify RuntimeEventMapper; that is RTVS-05.
- Do not modify RuntimeEventPoller integration; that is RTVS-07.

Dependencies: RTVS-01, RTVS-02.
Parallelizable with: RTVS-04, RTVS-05.

## Acceptance criteria
- Projector creates and updates user, assistant text, assistant thinking, and assistant error blocks from runtime events.
- Streaming deltas append deterministically without duplicating text on replay.
- Message completion marks assistant/thinking blocks non-streaming.
- Focused projector tests cover text delta replay, thinking delta replay, and assistant failure.
- castor deptrac passes.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-19T14:13:02.228Z
- Recorded fork run: m9zuvvqdpw58
- Summary: Launched implementation fork for RTVS-03 in worktree `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/rtvs-03-transcript-projector-assistant-stream`. Scope: TranscriptProjector assistant/user stream support; focused tests and deptrac; commit on task branch.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-19T14:31:30.224Z
- Recorded fork run: m9zuvvqdpw58
- Validation: castor test --filter=TranscriptProjectorTest: OK (26 tests, 96 assertions); castor deptrac: OK (0 violations); castor test: OK (648 tests, 9111 assertions; 1 pre-existing PHPUnit notice)
- Summary: RTVS-03 implementation complete on branch `task/rtvs-03-transcript-projector-assistant-stream` at commit `d98fbc19`. Added `TranscriptProjector` for user message and assistant text/thinking stream projection using array runtime events to preserve `AppRuntimeProjection: ~` deptrac boundary. Added focused `TranscriptProjectorTest` coverage for user blocks, assistant text/thinking deltas, replay determinism, completion, failure, unknown/orphan events, reset, and metadata. Notes: RTVS-04 will likely conflict additively in `TranscriptProjector::accept()` and `TranscriptProjectorTest.php`; projector intentionally uses raw event type strings rather than importing protocol enum.

- Moved IN-PROGRESS → CODE-REVIEW.
- Pushed task/rtvs-03-transcript-projector-assistant-stream to origin.
- branch 'task/rtvs-03-transcript-projector-assistant-stream' set up to track 'origin/task/rtvs-03-transcript-projector-assistant-stream'.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-19T20:45:31.811Z
- Updated PR Status: closed
- Summary: PR #30 closed as superseded. RTVS-03 assistant/user projector work is being folded into RTVS-04 / PR #31 so `TranscriptProjector` lands as one cohesive implementation instead of two conflicting branches.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-19T21:55:37.396Z
- Updated PR Status: closed/superseded
- Validation: PR #30 state: CLOSED, not merged; RTVS-04 / PR #31 state: MERGED; RTVS-03 acceptance scope is covered by the merged PR #31 projector tests: castor test --filter=TranscriptProjectorTest OK (61 tests, 227 assertions)
- Summary: Closed as superseded and marked done without merging the obsolete RTVS-03 branch. Its accepted scope (user message and assistant text/thinking projection) landed through RTVS-04 / PR #31 in the unified Symfony EventDispatcher projection pipeline. PR #30 remains closed without merge to avoid merging the older conflicting projector implementation.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-19T21:55:47.166Z
- Moved CODE-REVIEW → DONE as superseded without merging branch `task/rtvs-03-transcript-projector-assistant-stream`.
- Reason: PR #30 was closed without merge; RTVS-03 scope landed through merged RTVS-04 / PR #31 unified projection pipeline.
- Obsolete RTVS-03 branch/worktree should not be merged because it contains the older conflicting projector implementation.
