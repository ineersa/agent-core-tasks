# Document PHAR-safe process transport follow-up

## Goal
JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient currently assumes a source checkout and spawns bin/console from dirname(__DIR__, 4). For now, document this as a known limitation/TODO and outline the eventual self-executable/PHAR-safe process transport approach.

## Acceptance criteria
- JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient has a clear TODO/comment explaining why dirname(__DIR__, 4) and bin/console are source-checkout assumptions.
- A follow-up note exists in docs or task notes describing the future SelfExecutableLocator/process transport strategy for PHAR/binary distribution.
- No behavioral change required unless trivial and safe.
- castor check passes.

- Validation: `castor check` in worktree: deptrac passed, phpunit passed (228 tests, 7750 assertions), cs-fixer passed; full check blocked by pre-existing PHPStan error in `.castor/tasks.php:191` unrelated to this task.; `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse ... JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient.php`: passed.; `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run ... JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient.php`: passed.
- Summary: Fork vrd2dxwnotxy completed implementation. Commit `9a2d54c86ff9bf5f511c2982040ecad0730e00b1` on task branch documents source-checkout assumptions in `JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient` and adds `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Process/AGENTS.md` with the future SelfExecutableLocator/BinaryLocator strategy. Behavior unchanged.
