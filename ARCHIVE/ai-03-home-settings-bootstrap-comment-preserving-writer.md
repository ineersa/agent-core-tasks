# AI-03 Home settings bootstrap and comment-preserving settings writer

## Goal
Plan reference: .pi/plans/symfony_ai_platform_integration_plan.md#ai-03--home-settings-bootstrap-and-comment-preserving-settings-writer

Goal: support user defaults/favorites without destroying hand-written settings comments.

Depends on: AI-01.

Parallelism: can run alongside AI-02 and AI-08 after AI-01; unblocks AI-07 persistence.

Scope:
- On startup/config resolution, if `~/.hatfield/settings.yaml` is missing, initialize it from documented defaults/examples.
- Add home settings writer service for machine-managed changes: `ai.default_model`, `ai.default_reasoning`, later model favorites.
- Preserve existing comments and unrelated keys where possible.
- If perfect comment preservation is not possible with current YAML stack, constrain writes to targeted scalar replacements and fail safely rather than rewriting the whole file.

## Acceptance criteria
- Missing home settings file is created once.
- Updating model/reasoning does not remove existing comments from the file.
- Project `.hatfield/settings.yaml` remains the example/project override file; do not recreate `.hatfield.example/`.
- Suggested validation: `castor test --filter Settings`.

- Recorded fork run: 21k2xecv9pqo
- Summary: Launched fork 21k2xecv9pqo to restrain/simplify HomeSettingsWriter further per review. Scope: replace ~300-line parser with tiny text/regex helper for only writeDefaultModel/writeDefaultReasoning; insert under ai or append ai block if missing; keep small yamlScalar helper; reduce tests to core behavior; run castor check; commit and push PR #10 branch.

- Summary: PR #10 minimal writer rewrite completed by fork 21k2xecv9pqo and pushed. Added commit 63476262 shrinking HomeSettingsWriter from ~300 lines to 72 lines: two public methods (writeDefaultModel/writeDefaultReasoning), one regex-based writeAiKey helper with three branches (replace existing active/commented line, insert after ai:, append ai block), and one tiny yamlScalar helper. Tests reduced to 11 focused cases. This intentionally favors simple known-file mutation over generic YAML editing.
