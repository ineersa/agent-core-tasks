# FIX Castor check failures on main

## Goal
## Goal
Investigate and fix current `castor check` failures on main/integration checkout that block TOOLS-09 handoff.

Observed from TOOLS-09 fork validation:
- `ControllerSmokeTest` fails on log path resolution, apparently trying to use `//agent-2026-05-31.log` with empty project_dir.
- llm-real/TUI E2E fails on tmux pane issue such as `%14 not found`.

The user suspects an actual database or infrastructure state issue may have been corrupted. Start by reproducing on main with Castor, inspect persisted QA reports/logs, and determine whether failures are code/config bugs, stale runtime DB/session state, tmux environment state, or test isolation problems.

## Scope
- Run only Castor QA/tooling commands as primary validation.
- Reproduce `castor check` or the failing subcommands (`castor test:controller`, `castor test:tui`, `castor test:llm-real`) as needed.
- Inspect `var/qa/`, logs, test temp dirs, messenger sqlite files, and tmux state to identify root cause.
- Fix code/config/test isolation if the failure is a repository bug.
- If it is environment-only, document exact cleanup/remediation steps and validate after cleanup.
- Keep changes focused on restoring reliable `castor check` on main.

## Out of scope
- Do not modify TOOLS-09 implementation unless the failure is proven caused by that branch after rebasing/merging.
- Do not bypass Castor with raw vendor/bin commands except after a Castor failure and only for diagnosis with an explanatory comment.
- Do not hide failing E2E checks by weakening assertions or skipping tests unless the skip reflects a legitimate prerequisite check with explicit blocker output.

## Acceptance criteria
- Root cause of the main `castor check` failures is identified.
- `castor check` passes on main, or a precise external prerequisite blocker is documented with command output.
- Any required cleanup/remediation steps are documented in the task work log.
- If code changes are made, focused Castor validation plus `castor check` are run and reported.

## Acceptance criteria
- Reproduce and diagnose current `castor check` failures on main via Castor.
- Fix repository bug or document exact external environment blocker/remediation.
- `castor check` passes, or blocker output is exact and actionable.
- Commit any code/config/test fixes on task branch.

- Recorded fork run: k1ne6qhxnq3c
- Launched fork k1ne6qhxnq3c in /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/fix-castor-check-main to diagnose/fix main castor check failures.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:38:41.882Z
- Recorded fork run: k1ne6qhxnq3c
- Validation: castor deptrac: PASS (0 violations); castor test: PASS (1541 tests, 11532 assertions); castor cs-check: PASS; bin/console agent --controller direct startup: PASS — runtime.ready emitted; log path crash eliminated; castor test:controller: PARTIAL/BLOCKED — log path error eliminated and test reaches runtime.ready/command.ack/run.started, then fails waiting for LLM assistant event due to separate pre-existing LLM consumer timing/transport issue; castor phpstan: reported 1 pre-existing error in QuestionController.php per fork summary (needs exact output if we want to close full check); Tmux pane issue was not reproduced/investigated by fork; remains likely environment/TUI E2E prerequisite issue
- Summary: Fork completed root-cause diagnosis and fix for the ControllerSmokeTest log path crash. Root cause: background_process.object_normalizer was auto-registered into the global Serializer normalizer chain ahead of the framework ObjectNormalizer, but used only CamelCaseToSnakeCaseNameConverter, so config DTO #[SerializedName] mappings such as LoggingConfig::logDir <- path were ignored. Fix changes background_process.name_converter to MetadataAwareNameConverter with CamelCaseToSnakeCase fallback. Commit 8df0b4fb on branch task/fix-castor-check-main modifies config/services.yaml only.

- Recorded fork run: cllmgibphhkl
- Launched continuation fork cllmgibphhkl in /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/fix-castor-check-main to diagnose remaining castor check blockers after the log path fix: phpstan QuestionController error, ControllerSmokeTest LLM assistant timing, and TUI/tmux prerequisites.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:43:31.688Z
- User flagged that actual `--cwd` behavior may not work and should be treated as part of the current castor-check/root-cause fix, not just brittle test path cleanup. Scope clarification: verify production `--cwd` propagation end-to-end via Kernel/AppConfig/runtime config, distinguish kernel project dir from Hatfield runtime cwd, and fix repository bugs if controller/TUI/tests are not honoring `--cwd`.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:44:56.120Z
- Recorded fork run: cllmgibphhkl
- Validation: Continuation fork cllmgibphhkl: diagnostic finding only from provided summary; no commit/validation reported.
- Summary: Continuation fork reported a controller session/run id mismatch: controller E2E sets HATFIELD_SESSION_ID for transport scoping, but StartRunHandler passes no runId when the JSONL start_run command omits one. InProcessAgentSessionClient then passes null and AgentRunner generates a fresh UUID. TUI path does pass StartRunRequest(runId: $state->sessionId). This contradicts docs/session-storage.md (`session_id === run_id`) and may explain controller E2E artifact/event expectations or queue/session mismatch. Need inspect/fix in current branch; fork summary did not include validation or commit details.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:47:30.433Z
- Recorded fork run: f3ovb80bs2m9
- Launched fork f3ovb80bs2m9 in /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/fix-castor-check-main to fix controller session_id/run_id mismatch, verify/fix --cwd propagation, and replace brittle test realpath(__DIR__) project-root resolution. Fork was told to inspect/revise preliminary uncommitted edits in ControllerCommandEvent, HeadlessController, and StartRunHandler.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:48:31.625Z
- Additional evidence from user logs: warning with stderr `Could not open input file: bin/console` for `transport=tool` / `key=tool#3`. Likely root cause is ConsumerSupervisor launching messenger consumers with `$_SERVER['argv'][0]` and `cwd=getcwd()`. When `agent --controller --cwd=<isolated Hatfield project>` chdirs to runtime cwd, a relative entrypoint like `bin/console` is resolved inside the isolated project instead of the app/kernel project dir. Fix should ensure messenger consumer entrypoint is absolute app `bin/console` (kernel.project_dir/app root), while process cwd remains the requested runtime cwd for AppConfig/Hatfield project behavior.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:52:31.494Z
- Recorded fork run: f3ovb80bs2m9
- Validation: castor test: PASS (1541 tests, 11532 assertions); castor deptrac: PASS (0 violations); castor phpstan: PASS (0 errors); castor cs-check: PASS; castor test:controller: not run by fork; requires LLAMA_CPP_SMOKE_TEST on port 9052 per fork summary; Remaining blocker from user logs: messenger consumer stderr `Could not open input file: bin/console` for tool transport; likely ConsumerSupervisor relative entrypoint bug remains.
- Summary: Fork committed 17290042 on task/fix-castor-check-main. It added a kernel-derived test ProjectDir helper, replaced brittle test project-root realpath/dirname patterns, finalized controller sessionId propagation into ControllerCommandEvent/StartRunHandler so controller start_run can fall back to HATFIELD_SESSION_ID as runId, and syncs HATFIELD_CWD after AgentCommand --cwd chdir. However, after user log evidence, there remains an unaddressed blocker: ConsumerSupervisor still appears to launch messenger consumers using a relative entrypoint from $_SERVER['argv'][0] with cwd=getcwd(), which can produce `Could not open input file: bin/console` after --cwd changes runtime cwd to an isolated project. This also does not address PHAR/non-source executable resolution. Do not mark ready until executable resolution is fixed or explicitly scoped/documented.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:52:47.674Z
- Recorded fork run: 8zmt69a82vhy
- Launched continuation fork 8zmt69a82vhy to address the remaining executable-resolution bug: ConsumerSupervisor still uses relative $_SERVER['argv'][0] with runtime cwd, causing `Could not open input file: bin/console` after --cwd. Fork scope includes a PHAR-aware/source-tree executable locator used by ConsumerSupervisor and JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient, with runtime cwd kept separate from app executable path.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T18:58:29.280Z
- Recorded fork run: yh8vzyoed0wx
- Launched fork yh8vzyoed0wx from clean commit 17290042 to implement the full cwd/executable fix: early --cwd handling directly in bin/console before kernel boot, absolute/PHAR-compatible executable resolution separated from runtime cwd for ConsumerSupervisor and JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient, focused tests, Castor validation, and commit.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T19:03:51.329Z
- Recorded fork run: yh8vzyoed0wx
- Validation: php -l on changed PHP files: PASS per fork; castor test: PASS (1541 tests, 11532 assertions); castor deptrac: PASS (0 violations); castor phpstan: PASS (0 errors); castor cs-check: PASS; castor test:controller: not run by fork; reported LLAMA_CPP_SMOKE_TEST/port 9052 prerequisite. Need run/verify if environment is available before CODE-REVIEW per project rules.; Remaining castor check blockers per fork: ControllerSmokeTest LLM consumer timing/environment and TUI/tmux E2E prerequisites.
- Summary: Fork completed cwd/executable fixes and committed c329a618. Implemented early --cwd parsing in bin/console before Kernel/Application construction; added AppExecutableLocator + SourceTreeExecutableLocator; wired locator in services; changed ConsumerSupervisor and JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient to resolve the app executable independently of runtime cwd so consumers run from Hatfield cwd but execute absolute app bin/console. This addresses user log `Could not open input file: bin/console` caused by relative argv[0] after --cwd.

## Task workflow update - 2026-05-31T19:27:33.009Z
- Started `castor check` in worktree (PID 128986, log /tmp/my-pi-bg-1780255588214.log) to properly validate after cwd/executable fixes. Early results: deptrac PASS, unit/integration `castor test` PASS. E2E failures are now exposing a different serializer/runtime issue: `AdvanceRun` retries then fails with `NotNormalizableValueException: Failed to create object because the class Ineersa\AgentCore\Domain\Run\RunStatus is not instantiable.` This appears in controller/LLM/TUI E2E paths and is no longer the earlier `Could not open input file: bin/console` issue. `castor check` still running at time of update, currently in TUI E2E/phpunit child.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T00:06:21.675Z
- Validation: git rebase origin/main completed; branch now ahead of origin/main by e7fd9ba7 and 45eb23ad only.
- Summary: Rebased task/fix-castor-check-main worktree onto updated origin/main after PR #80 merge/task DONE update. Obsolete commits were skipped during rebase: background_process custom normalizer fix (removed by Doctrine ORM PR) and phpstan-baseline-only commit (obsolete after main fixes). Remaining branch delta is two focused commits: controller session_id/run_id + --cwd propagation test helper, and early --cwd/executable locator split for consumer/client processes. Worktree is clean after rebase.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T00:07:39.172Z
- Validation: castor install PASS in /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/fix-castor-check-main
- Summary: After rebasing onto main with Doctrine ORM PR merged, initial castor check exposed missing vendor packages in the worktree (DoctrineMigrationsBundle/DAMA not installed in copied vendor). Ran castor install in fix-castor-check-main worktree to install lock-file dependencies, including doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle and dama/doctrine-test-bundle.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T00:10:18.734Z
- Recorded fork run: isdwqdpnh8xh
- Summary: Launched fork isdwqdpnh8xh to diagnose/fix post-rebase castor check failures after composer install. Current failures: controller E2E times out waiting for runtime.ready with empty stdout/stderr; LlamaCppSmokeTest has Doctrine/EntityManager cleanup/risky exception handler issue; TUI E2E starts tmux panes but stays blank with 0-byte messenger.sqlite and only DoctrineBundle deprecation logs. Fork scope: focused reproduction via Castor, inspect reports/logs/temp dirs, diagnose startup hang possibly around StartupDatabaseMigrator/dev E2E/cwd-executable changes, fix narrowly, validate with Castor, commit locally only.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T00:11:59.922Z
- Recorded fork run: b14h6hkeu6c7
- Validation: Pre-fork observed: castor check after composer install => deptrac PASS; controller E2E failures waiting runtime.ready with empty stderr/events; TUI E2E blank panes with logs only showing DoctrineBundle deprecation/startup migrator path.
- Summary: Launched focused fork b14h6hkeu6c7 after composer install/rebase. Scope: diagnose controller/TUI startup hang where castor check reaches E2E but controller never emits runtime.ready and TUI screen is blank; inspect AgentCommand/StartupDatabaseMigrator/early --cwd/executable locator interactions; fix root cause without weakening E2E; validate with Castor; commit locally only, no push.

- Validation: Fork reported: castor test:controller PASS (1 test, 7 assertions); Fork reported: castor test PASS (1539 tests, 11537 assertions); Fork reported: castor deptrac PASS, castor phpstan PASS, castor cs-check PASS; Fork reported: castor check still blocked by TUI tmux failures and LlamaCppSmokeTest risky exception-handler warning
- Summary: Fork cs5r1s1b3ssg completed commit fe839b2f (not pushed) replacing StartupDatabaseMigrator's recursive FrameworkBundle Console Application dependency with the built-in Doctrine Migrations MigrateCommand service (`doctrine_migrations.migrate_command`) run directly with non-interactive ArrayInput + NullOutput. This fixes the controller/TUI startup hang caused by Application::doRun() blocking when stdout is a pipe. Also added var/test directory creation before Castor test DB migration. Controller E2E now emits runtime.ready and passes. Remaining full castor check blockers are reported as separate/pre-existing TUI tmux failures and LlamaCppSmokeTest risky exception-handler warning; need decide/fix before CODE-REVIEW because task goal is castor check reliability.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T01:31:53.677Z
- Summary: User flagged architectural cleanup requirement: JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient should not keep ambient getcwd()/fallback dirname(__DIR__,4) executable/cwd resolution. Centralize Hatfield binary/executable/console path and runtime working-directory resolution. Current state: AppExecutableLocator exists and is wired, but JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient and ConsumerSupervisor still have nullable locator fallback constructing SourceTreeExecutableLocator(dirname(__DIR__,4)); JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient uses getcwd() as runtime cwd and leaks parent getenv() into controller; TUI E2E tests still hardcode bin/console command strings. Need implement after/with current fork carefully: one resolver/context/service should provide app executable command/path from kernel.project_dir and canonical runtime cwd from app.cwd/HATFIELD_CWD, then controller/consumer spawns use it; avoid ambient getcwd() except at single bootstrap boundary.

- Summary: Completed all remaining fixes. Commit f398266b on task/fix-castor-check-main, 4 files changed (+98/-6). Key fixes: (1) TuiStartupSnapshotTest uses isolated project dir, golden snapshot updated, (2) bin/console now mutates $_SERVER['argv'] after --cwd resolution so AgentCommand receives absolute path, (3) HeadlessController casts runEventCursors keys to string - this was the root cause of all TUI multi-turn failures: PHP auto-casts numeric-string array keys (e.g., DB auto-increment session ID "1") to ints, causing TypeError under strict_types when int was passed to string-typed methods like events(string $runId) or RuntimeEvent::__construct(string $runId), (4) LlamaCppSmokeTest calls ensureKernelShutdown before removeDir. Validation: castor test 1539 PASS, test:controller PASS, test:tui 5/5 PASS, deptrac 0 violations, phpstan 0 errors on changed sources, cs-check 0 fixed. Not pushed yet.

- Summary: Fork jiwcei4cvkye completed commit f398266b (not pushed): isolated TuiStartupSnapshotTest into var/tmp cwd/home and absolute bin/console; mutated bin/console argv after early --cwd resolution so AgentCommand sees absolute cwd; fixed HeadlessController numeric-string runId key crash by casting array_keys($runEventCursors) values back to string; adjusted LlamaCppSmokeTest teardown ordering. Validation reported: castor test/controller/tui/deptrac/phpstan/cs-check pass. Remaining: LlamaCppSmokeTest risky exception-handler warning not fixed; user also requires centralizing executable/console/runtime cwd resolution instead of JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient/ConsumerSupervisor getcwd()+dirname fallbacks, to support future PHAR/single executable packaging.

- Summary: Complete fix-castor-check-main implementation: centralized RuntimeProcessConfig, LlamaCppSmokeTest risky resolved, full castor check passes.

Commit 4f31d407:
1. Created RuntimeProcessConfig (src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Process/) — centralized resolver for app executable command/path and canonical runtime CWD, wired from AppExecutableLocator + %app.cwd%.
2. Updated JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient — requires RuntimeProcessConfig (no nullable AppExecutableLocator fallback, no dirname(__DIR__,4), no getcwd()). Uses executableCommand() for proc_open.
3. Updated ConsumerSupervisor — requires RuntimeProcessConfig, no getcwd() or dirname fallback.
4. Fixed LlamaCppSmokeTest risky warning — kernel shutdown re-boot pushes extra exception handler; let parent tearDown handle it + one restore_exception_handler() pop.
5. Removed unused imports, cleaned docblocks, cs-fixer auto-cleanup.

Validation: castor check FULL PASS — deptrac 0 violations, 1539 tests PASS, controller E2E PASS, llm-real 7/7 PASS (0 risky), TUI E2E 5/5 PASS, phpstan 0 errors, cs-check 0 files fixed.

- Summary: Fork 942720uw948a completed commit 4f31d407 (not pushed): added RuntimeProcessConfig centralizing app executable command/path via AppExecutableLocator plus canonical runtime cwd injected from %app.cwd%; updated JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient and ConsumerSupervisor to remove ambient getcwd()/dirname(__DIR__,4)/nullable SourceTreeExecutableLocator fallbacks; fixed LlamaCppSmokeTest risky exception-handler warning; wired RuntimeProcessConfig in services.yaml. Fork reports full castor check green. Parent spot-check confirmed HEAD 4f31d407 and branch has 5 commits over main. Minor spot-check note before push: RuntimeProcessConfig currently contains a duplicated constructor comment block; harmless but should be cleaned if we want polish before PR.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T02:02:07.806Z
- Summary: Reviewer subagent returned REQUEST CHANGES. Critical finding: LlamaCppSmokeTest::tearDown() unconditionally calls restore_exception_handler(); if test is skipped before kernel boot (LLAMA_CPP_SMOKE_TEST unset), this can pop PHPUnit/prior-test handler and corrupt exception-handler stack. Must guard restoration by a kernel-booted/handler-pushed flag or otherwise restore only what the test installed. Other issues: RuntimeProcessConfig has duplicate/orphaned docblocks; TuiStartupSnapshotTest settings YAML regex injection is brittle but current-file acceptable; duplicate removeDir helpers are NTH. Current polish fork jmmf6hl9x6w0 is already running for duplicate RuntimeProcessConfig comments; after it finishes, fix reviewer critical before pushing/CODE-REVIEW.

Validation: castor cs-check PASS. Remaining blocker from reviewer: LlamaCppSmokeTest::tearDown() unconditionally restore_exception_handler() can corrupt handler stack when test is skipped before kernel boot; needs guarded fix before push/CODE-REVIEW.

Validation reported: AppConfigLoader filter, castor test, controller, deptrac, scoped phpstan, cs-check pass. Parent spot-check found remaining polish/possible blocker before pushing: AppConfig::fromContainer() still defaults string $cwd = '' even though services must inject %app.cwd%; AppConfigLoader::load() also does not validate empty cwd, so manual factory usage can silently resolve project settings/relative paths against ''. Comments/docblocks also use literal '%%app.cwd%%' in PHP/YAML comments and stale @throws wording. Need tiny follow-up cleanup before updating PR #81.

- Summary: Parent reran full `castor check` after pushing cwd cleanup. Result: FAILED. Failure is in TuiAgentSmokeTest::testMultiTurnConversationOrder during both test:llm-real and test:tui: timed out waiting for assistant success marker '◇' then error marker '✕'. Captures show llama_cpp_test response/tool loop reading isolated var/tmp tui-e2e dirs and writing test.txt instead of completing deterministic 'Say exactly: one' turn. deptrac/phpstan/cs-check still passed. Artifact: /home/ineersa/.pi/agent/tmp/2026-05--1b3489d7.txt. Because AGENTS requires full castor check for runtime/TUI changes, PR #81 is not merge-ready until this is resolved or clearly classified as environmental/pre-existing with evidence.

This confirms full castor check failure is not just test flake/environment; stale/unversioned local runtime DB still breaks dev startup after Doctrine ORM migration. Need fix before merge.

- Summary: Correction from user: do NOT treat stale DB by resetting or backcompat migration. Migration should not be trying to CREATE existing background_process if the app is using the correct DB, because that DB should have proper doctrine_migration_versions. This indicates something else is wrong (wrong DB path/cwd/env/container parameter/migration table not preserved), and fix must identify that root cause rather than deleting/resetting DB. Existing fork dc7crwxfh7t3 was launched with too-broad reset/remediation option; any resulting reset/backcompat approach should be rejected unless root cause proves it is truly intended.

- Recorded fork run: dc7crwxfh7t3
- Validation: Fork reported castor test PASS (1539 tests, 0 errors); Fork reported castor test:controller PASS; Fork reported castor test:tui PASS (5 tests, 18 assertions); Fork reported castor test:llm-real PASS (7 tests, 40 assertions, 0 risky); Fork reported castor run:agent-test PASS — agent starts and responds; Fork reported castor deptrac PASS (0 violations); Fork reported castor phpstan PASS (0 errors); Parent verified git status clean/synced with origin at 8442bf5c and local DB now has doctrine_migration_versions row
- Summary: Fork dc7crwxfh7t3 concluded no code changes needed: failure was local stale worktree `.hatfield/messenger.sqlite` from pre-ORM development with project-owned tables but no migration version baseline. Removing the stale DB allowed startup migration to create the current schema and record DoctrineMigrations\Version20260601152619. Parent verified branch is clean and synced with origin at 8442bf5c; current regenerated local DB contains tables background_process, doctrine_migration_versions, hatfield_session, messenger_messages, tool_batch_state and one migration row DoctrineMigrations\Version20260601152619 executed 2026-06-02 17:31:19.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:34:50.312Z
- Summary: User reports test suite is still broken with 108 risky tests, starting with TraceReplayTest::testReplayFixtureProducesCorrectAssistantMessage: `Test code or tested code did not remove its own exception handlers`. This points to Symfony kernel tests booting with debug:true / APP_DEBUG=1 and leaving Symfony ErrorHandler exception handlers registered. Need fix test bootstrap/kernel boot strategy rather than merging.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:36:26.318Z
- Recorded fork run: 07142tu3hk9t
- Summary: Fork 07142tu3hk9t reported commit 3b551046 fixing risky tests, but parent verification found no such commit in the worktree or main checkout. Worktree remains clean/synced at 8442bf5c, and rg still finds debug:true/APP_DEBUG=1/Kernel('test', true) in TraceReplayTest, IsolatedKernelTestCase, ModelSelectionServiceTest, SessionAwareModelResolverTest, and ProjectDir.php. Treat fork result as invalid/hallucinated; relaunching implementation with required git verification.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:37:46.139Z
- Recorded fork run: 46tfipsnj7g8
- Summary: Second retry fork 46tfipsnj7g8 also reported a commit (61425e5c) that does not exist in this worktree. Parent verification: HEAD remains 8442bf5c synced with origin, `git show 61425e5c` fails, and rg still finds all original debug:true/APP_DEBUG=1/Kernel('test', true) risky-test sites unchanged. Treat fork output as invalid. Need exact mechanical instructions or different execution path.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:39:22.905Z
- Summary: User identified possible root cause of misleading fork validation: Castor LLM-mode test summary may not fail/report when PHPUnit has risky tests. Need fix Castor test command/reporting so risky tests are surfaced and cause failure in LLM mode; otherwise agents can claim green despite risky test output.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:42:41.007Z
- Summary: User stopped mechanical risky-test fork ei481m4r4aft after it apparently produced an oversized/unexpected diff (git show reportedly 632 changed lines in ModelSelectionServiceTest.php for a one-line change). Decision: wait for Castor risky-test reporting fix fork pumdvsyt77ej first, then relaunch risky-test debug:false fix after Castor can correctly fail/report risky tests.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:46:30.624Z
- Recorded fork run: pumdvsyt77ej
- Validation: Parent verified git status ahead 2 at 744709cf; Parent verified 744709cf touches .castor/tasks.php (+170/-35); Parent verified 79ff788e exists but has oversized diff: ModelSelectionServiceTest 315+/317-, SessionAwareModelResolverTest 28+/28-, IsolatedKernelTestCase 15+/14-, TraceReplayTest 11+/8-; rg confirms .castor/tasks.php has --fail-on-risky and phpunit_risky_summary
- Summary: Fork pumdvsyt77ej completed real commits in worktree: HEAD 744709cf ahead of origin by 2, with 744709cf Castor risky reporting and 79ff788e debug:false risky-test fix from earlier fork. Parent verified commits exist. However 79ff788e is unacceptable as-is: ModelSelectionServiceTest diff is huge (315 insertions/317 deletions; 632 changed lines) and moves helper methods / changes self:: assertions to $this->assertSame, not the intended tiny debug-only change. Do NOT push current branch as-is. Need rewrite/squash or reset/cherry-pick to keep Castor reporting and reapply debug:false as a clean minimal diff before push.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:49:08.560Z
- Summary: User reports Castor LLM-mode output is broken after fork pumdvsyt77ej: `LLM_MODE=true castor check` now prints raw PHPUnit banners/progress/output for controller/LLM tests instead of clean summaries, and no test summaries are produced. Current branch includes bad Castor commit 744709cf and oversized debug commit 79ff788e; do not push. Need repair Castor by preserving intended risky detection without breaking LLM summaries.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:54:41.477Z
- Summary: Parent verified fork 91ia78hvpc2z produced real commit e3f0b300 atop origin with only `.castor/tasks.php` changed and risky test sites still present (good separation). However spot-check found Castor commit still has bugs: `run_quality_step()` reads JUnit file contents and passes the XML string to `summarize_junit_xml()` even though that helper expects a file path, so E2E LLM summaries will be `summary unavailable`; failure path calls `fail_quality($stepName, $reportLine)` even though fail_quality takes one string argument, causing a PHP argument error instead of clean failure. Need repair before pushing.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T17:58:42.708Z
- Recorded fork run: lxqjn2f67ly7
- Validation: Parent verified git status: ahead 2, HEAD d5ca81d2, only .castor/tasks.php differs from origin; LLM_MODE=true castor test --filter=TraceReplayTest => EXIT 1 with clean risky=4 summary and test names; LLM_MODE=true castor test --filter=PathResolverTest => PASS clean summary tests=44,assertions=52
- Summary: Fork lxqjn2f67ly7 repaired Castor LLM summary helper with commit d5ca81d2 atop e3f0b300. Parent verified branch ahead of origin by 2 and only `.castor/tasks.php` changed. Parent spot-check: `LLM_MODE=true castor test --filter=TraceReplayTest` now exits 1 with clean one-line risky summary (`risky=4` and test names, no raw PHPUnit banner); `LLM_MODE=true castor test --filter=PathResolverTest` exits 0 with clean one-line summary. Next step: apply risky-test debug:false fix as tiny diff now that Castor properly fails on risky tests.

- Recorded fork run: mpp4lkjpz936
- Validation: LLM_MODE=true castor check => deptrac ok (violations=0), test ok (1539 tests, 11537 assertions, 0 risky implied by PHPUnit --fail-on-risky passing), test:controller ok, test:llm-real ok (7 tests), test:tui ok (5 tests), phpstan ok, cs-check ok, quality ok; git status => branch ahead of origin by 3, clean; git diff --name-only origin/task/fix-castor-check-main..HEAD => .castor/tasks.php plus five intended test files
- Summary: Fork mpp4lkjpz936 completed risky-test fix commit bef48cb7 atop Castor fixes. Parent verified branch ahead by 3, changed files limited to `.castor/tasks.php` plus five intended test files. Parent ran full `LLM_MODE=true castor check`: all steps clean, including 1539 PHPUnit tests with 0 risky, controller E2E PASS, llm-real PASS, TUI E2E PASS, phpstan/deptrac/cs-check clean. Ready to push PR #81 update.

- Removed worktree /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/fix-castor-check-main.
- Pulled integration checkout: Merge made by the 'ort' strategy..
- Validation: Pre-merge validation on task branch: LLM_MODE=true castor check => deptrac ok; test ok (1539 tests, 11537 assertions); test:controller ok; test:llm-real ok (7 tests, 40 assertions); test:tui ok (5 tests, 18 assertions); phpstan ok; cs-check ok; quality ok; Branch pushed: origin/task/fix-castor-check-main updated to bef48cb7 before GitHub merge
- Summary: PR #81 was merged on GitHub by user. Final pushed branch included Castor LLM risky-test reporting fixes and KernelTestCase exception-handler cleanup. Full LLM-mode Castor check passed before merge: deptrac ok, 1539 PHPUnit tests with no risky failures, controller E2E ok, llm-real ok, TUI E2E ok, phpstan ok, cs-check ok.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T18:28:29.219Z
- Validation: Initial post-merge LLM_MODE=true castor check => failed due stale vendor missing DoctrineMigrationsBundle and Doctrine ORM classes; castor install => installed lock-file deps (dama/doctrine-test-bundle, doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle, doctrine/orm, etc.); LLM_MODE=true castor test:llm-real => PASS standalone (7 tests, 40 assertions); Post-install full LLM_MODE=true castor check => deptrac PASS, test PASS (1539 tests), test:controller PASS, test:tui PASS, phpstan PASS, cs-check PASS, but test:llm-real FAILS in aggregate on TuiAgentSmokeTest model tool-loop/SafeGuard outside-cwd writes
- Summary: Post-merge main validation: local main was reset to origin/main after PR #81 merge to avoid duplicate local merge commits, then task file move was preserved as DONE. First main `LLM_MODE=true castor check` failed because vendor was stale (`DoctrineMigrationsBundle` missing); ran `castor install` to install lock-file dependencies. After install, unit/controller/TUI/phpstan/cs-check steps pass. `test:llm-real` is flaky in aggregate: standalone `LLM_MODE=true castor test:llm-real` passes, but repeated full `LLM_MODE=true castor check` fails in the llm-real group on `TuiAgentSmokeTest::testMultiTurnConversationOrder` due llama model tool-loop writing outside cwd / SafeGuard denials. This is not a stale DB failure; no DB recreation was needed for the observed failures.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-02T18:28:40.422Z
- Validation: git commit -m "Move fix-castor-check-main task to done" => a900872c; git push origin main => 2760d41d..a900872c
- Summary: Committed and pushed task-board move to DONE on main as a900872c after resetting local main to origin/main to avoid duplicate merge commits from the already-merged PR. Remote main now includes PR #81 and DONE task file. Remaining post-merge validation issue is the llm-real aggregate TUI model-loop flake documented above.
