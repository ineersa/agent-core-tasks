 x# Clarify Hatfield settings merge semantics

## Goal
Keep the custom AppConfigLoader merge behavior, but make it obvious and well-tested. Rename/refactor/comment mergeSettings so future readers understand why array_merge_recursive() and plain array_replace_recursive() are not used for layered YAML settings.

## Acceptance criteria
- AppConfigLoader merge method name/comments explain semantics: associative arrays recursively overlay, lists replace entirely, scalars use higher-priority value.
- Code comments explicitly mention why array_merge_recursive() is unsuitable for scalar config overrides.
- Focused tests cover scalar override, nested associative merge, list replacement without append/index merge, and current null override behavior.
- Existing config resolution behavior remains unchanged.
- castor check passes.
