# EDITOR-12 Hatfield keybinding loader, conflict detection, and editor smoke

## Goal
Plan: .pi/plans/editor_rollout_plan.md

MVP: no.

Scope:
- Build a YAML → `Symfony\Component\Tui\Input\Keybindings` loader that reads Hatfield settings.
- Add keybinding conflict detection (duplicate bindings across actions).
- Generate footer key hints from active keymap instead of hardcoded text where applicable.
- Apply loaded keybindings to `PromptEditor`'s `EditorWidget` via `setKeybindings()`.
- Update docs: `docs/tui-architecture.md`, `docs/tui-testing.md`, `docs/settings.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- Add/refresh tmux e2e scenarios for editor interactions.

Rationale: Symfony TUI already has a full keybinding engine (`Keybindings` class, `KeybindingsTrait`, 36 default actions). We do NOT need to build `EditorKeymap` or `EditorInputRouter`. Only Hatfield YAML integration is new.

Exclusions:
- Do not build `EditorKeymap`, `EditorAction`, or `EditorInputRouter` — reuse Symfony TUI's `Keybindings`.
- Do not add tmux e2e tests to `castor check`.
- Do not reintroduce FrameworkBundle or HTTP app assumptions.

Dependencies: EDITOR-02, EDITOR-05, EDITOR-07.
Parallelizable with: none after dependencies.

## Acceptance criteria
- Keybindings can be configured through Hatfield settings with documented defaults.
- Conflicting keybindings are detected and reported clearly.
- Footer/help hints reflect active keymap where practical.
- Docs are updated in all relevant locations.
- `castor test:tui` passes or snapshot update steps are documented.
- `castor check` passes.

## Work log
- Created: 2026-05-18T00:16:39.944Z
- Updated: 2026-05-18 — Scope simplified: reuse Symfony TUI Keybindings class, build only YAML loader + conflict detection. Removed EditorKeymap/EditorAction/EditorInputRouter from scope.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T19:50:47.082Z
- Summary: Scope revised after planning discussion. Drop the original configurable YAML keybinding loader/conflict-detection scope as premature overhead. New scope: implement reliable multiline prompt newline with Ctrl+J (keep Shift+Enter only if Symfony already supports it), add an internal display/catalog HotkeyRegistry for core app/editor/completion/history/model hotkeys, add a `/hotkeys` slash command rendering a nice table of registered hotkeys, and optionally expose display-only extension hotkey hint registration if it fits current extension/TUI context. Do not build a full input router or user-configurable keymap. Execution remains in existing Symfony TUI widgets/listeners; registry is metadata/documentation/display only. Must include real TmuxHarness + test LLM E2E proof for Ctrl+J multiline input and `/hotkeys` visibility, plus docs updates.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T19:50:55.945Z
- Moved TODO → IN-PROGRESS.
- Created branch task/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke.
- Created worktree /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke.
- Copied vendor directory into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke.
- Copied .vera index into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke.
- Summary: Starting revised EDITOR-12 scope: Ctrl+J multiline prompt newline, internal metadata HotkeyRegistry, `/hotkeys` command table, docs, and real TmuxHarness E2E proof. Original YAML keybinding loader/conflict detection is explicitly dropped as premature overhead. Main agent remains orchestrator; implementation will be delegated to a fork.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T19:52:22.922Z
- Recorded fork run: x76yjmx0yw0f
- Summary: Started implementation fork x76yjmx0yw0f in worktree /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke. Fork scope: revise task body to new scope, add Ctrl+J multiline newline support, add display-only HotkeyRegistry/catalog, add `/hotkeys` slash command table, optionally expose non-breaking display-only extension hotkey hints, update docs, add mandatory real TmuxHarness E2E proof for Ctrl+J multiline and `/hotkeys`, run Castor validation, commit changes, leave worktree clean. Explicitly excluded: YAML keybinding loader, conflict detection config system, full input router, consumable extension hotkeys.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:21:54.747Z
- Recorded fork run: x76yjmx0yw0f
- Validation: Fork x76yjmx0yw0f reported `castor test` passed (2303 tests, 6727 assertions); Fork x76yjmx0yw0f reported `castor deptrac` passed (0 violations), `castor phpstan` passed (0 errors), `castor cs-check` clean; Fork x76yjmx0yw0f reported focused Hotkey/Slash/Completion tests passed; Fork x76yjmx0yw0f reported `castor test:tui --filter=HotkeySmoke` failed on Ctrl+J multiline E2E due LLM exploration timeout; required TUI proof remains incomplete; Orchestrator verified worktree dirty/uncommitted after fork, so follow-up implementation fork required
- Summary: Implementation fork x76yjmx0yw0f returned partially complete and uncommitted. Core code/docs/tests are present in the worktree but dirty at HEAD 86966046. Implemented pieces reported by fork: Ctrl+J keybinding via PromptEditor/InteractiveMode, display-only HotkeyRegistry/HotkeyBindingDTO/HotkeyProviderInterface, app/editor hotkey registrars, `/hotkeys` slash command, docs, unit tests, and initial TUI E2E. Blocking issue: required TmuxHarness E2E proof is not passing — Ctrl+J multiline test waits for assistant output and times out due test LLM exploration loop. Additional cleanup needed: task file was modified under `tasks/TODO/...` in the implementation branch even though workflow state is IN-PROGRESS; follow-up should revert task-file changes from the branch and leave task metadata to workflow tools.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:22:26.177Z
- Recorded fork run: vb78x9cy1wdm
- Summary: Launched follow-up fork vb78x9cy1wdm to finish revised EDITOR-12 after partial fork x76yjmx0yw0f. Scope: keep previous core implementation, revert unintended task-file changes from the task branch, fix HotkeySmoke TmuxHarness E2E so Ctrl+J multiline proof avoids LLM exploration by using shell-prefix output/canonical events, validate `/hotkeys` E2E, run Castor validation, commit intended source/docs/tests, leave worktree clean. Parent will verify fork result before any CODE-REVIEW workflow.

- Summary: Implementation complete at commit 4dc9b352. Revised EDITOR-12 scope delivered: Ctrl+J newline support (with Shift+Enter preserved), display-only HotkeyRegistry/HotkeyBindingDTO/HotkeyProviderInterface catalog, app/editor hotkey registrars, `/hotkeys` slash command table, docs updates, and real TmuxHarness E2E proof. Original YAML keybinding loader/conflict-detection/footer-hints/full-router scope remains excluded. Extension hotkey support is non-breaking display-only via provider seam; no ExtensionApi interface changes. Task-file and ChatScreen accidental changes were reverted from the branch. Orchestrator verified worktree clean at 4dc9b352 and integration checkout clean at bfc3d5f6. Diff stat: 17 files changed, 1105 insertions, 16 deletions.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:37:27.593Z
- Recorded fork run: d6zy70so8y9o
- Summary: Launched follow-up fork d6zy70so8y9o to improve `/hotkeys` rendering. Scope: replace plain grouped list with nicer per-section Unicode box-drawing tables; investigate whether section names can use theme accent color through the current transcript/theme pipeline without hardcoded ANSI or deptrac violations; if not cleanly possible, keep uncolored and document in handoff that accent-colored fragments belong to richer transcript rendering. Fork must update unit/E2E assertions, run Castor validation, commit, and leave worktree clean.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:46:08.010Z
- Recorded fork run: d6zy70so8y9o
- Validation: Fork d6zy70so8y9o validation: focused `castor test --filter='Hotkey|Hotkeys|SlashCommandRegistry|SlashCommandCompletion|CompletionListener'` passed (110 tests, 221 assertions); Fork d6zy70so8y9o validation: `castor test:tui --filter=HotkeySmoke` passed (2 tests, 6 assertions); Fork d6zy70so8y9o validation: full `castor test:tui` passed (13 tests, 35 assertions); Fork d6zy70so8y9o validation: full `castor test` passed (2306 tests, 6748 assertions); Fork d6zy70so8y9o validation: `castor deptrac` passed (0 violations), `castor phpstan` passed (0 errors), `castor cs-check` clean; Note for review: fork reported a residual timing risk in the existing Ctrl+J events.jsonl assertion (pane proof passes; event artifact may be timing-sensitive), not introduced by the table-only follow-up
- Summary: Follow-up `/hotkeys` table polish complete at commit af0cc15f. `/hotkeys` now renders per-context Unicode box-drawing tables with columns Keys, Action, Description; widths are computed from actual content with display-width-aware `mb_strwidth()` padding so arrows and multibyte characters align correctly; long cells truncate with ellipsis. Section names remain plain text because TuiCommand has no allowed dependency on TuiTheme and current TranscriptBlockRenderer applies only one color per block; accent-colored fragments should wait for richer transcript rendering/RENDER-02. Orchestrator verified worktree clean at af0cc15f and integration checkout clean at de434893. Diff: 2 files changed, 256 insertions, 23 deletions.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:47:36.942Z
- Recorded fork run: 8pvicrpkkgcc
- Summary: Launched follow-up fork 8pvicrpkkgcc after user rejected the plain white `/hotkeys` table. Scope: make `/hotkeys` theme-aware and visually styled using active theme colors, with section/context labels accented, borders muted/subtle, headers/keys/descriptions styled appropriately, without hardcoded ANSI literals and without violating deptrac. Fork may refactor table rendering out of TuiCommand or narrowly extend transcript styling if needed. Must keep HotkeyRegistry display-only, keep slash command flow, update unit and TmuxHarness E2E proof, run Castor validation, commit, and leave worktree clean.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:51:07.249Z
- Summary: User clarified that flaky tests are unacceptable and the HotkeySmoke Ctrl+J timing caveat must be fixed before CODE-REVIEW. Read-only scout diagnosed the flake: `testCtrlJInsertsNewlineViaShellPrefixMultilineCommand()` has a bonus events.jsonl assertion synchronized only by `usleep(300_000)` plus `glob($eventsDir . '*')`, creating timing and wrong-session races. The real feature proof is already the tmux pane-visible shell output from a false-positive-resistant multiline shell command: marker is never typed literally, and appears only if Ctrl+J inserted a newline and the full multiline shell command executed. Recommended deterministic fix: remove the bonus events.jsonl assertion, or replace it with polling for a known file/event path (no fixed sleep, no glob). This is now a blocker: do not move EDITOR-12 to CODE-REVIEW until HotkeySmoke is stable and full `castor test:tui` passes without carrying the flake.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T20:52:54.764Z
- Summary: User rejected the events.jsonl/sleep approach entirely. Correct TUI E2E proof for Ctrl+J must be purely real editor interaction: type `Hello`, send Ctrl+J, type `World`, capture/snapshot the pane while still in the editor, and assert the visible editor content has `Hello` and `World` on separate lines (newline between them). Do not use events.jsonl, fixed sleeps, shell-prefix command output, or LLM/session artifacts for this proof. `/hotkeys` E2E likewise should type `/hotkeys`, press Enter, and assert the visible command output/table in the TUI via tmux capture/snapshot, not sleep or event files. This is a hard blocker before CODE-REVIEW.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T21:02:16.759Z
- Recorded fork run: 8pvicrpkkgcc
- Validation: Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: `castor deptrac` passed (0 violations, 0 errors); Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: `castor phpstan` passed (0 errors); Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: `castor cs-check` clean; Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: `castor test --filter='HotkeyTableRenderer'` passed (7 tests, 48 assertions); Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: focused Hotkey/Slash/Completion tests passed (110 tests, 213 assertions); Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: full `castor test` passed (2313 tests, 6788 assertions); Fork 8pvicrpkkgcc validation: full `castor test:tui` passed (13 tests, 35 assertions); Blocking gap remains: Ctrl+J E2E must be rewritten to pure visual tmux snapshot/capture with `Hello` Ctrl+J `World`; no events.jsonl, no fixed sleeps, no shell-prefix output, no LLM/session artifacts
- Summary: Theme-aware `/hotkeys` renderer fork 8pvicrpkkgcc completed at commit f1fe4ac2. Implemented deptrac-safe architecture: SlashCommandRegistry now returns data-only HotkeyTableData, SubmitListener adapts it to TuiTranscript HotkeyTableRenderer, and HotkeyTableRenderer applies theme-derived ANSI styling for heading/sections/headers/keys/borders/descriptions. Colors reported: Accent for heading/sections/header row, Muted for borders/descriptions/footer, Success for key names, default Text for actions. No hardcoded ANSI colors; no MarkdownWidget; no YAML keybindings. Orchestrator verified worktree clean at f1fe4ac2 and integration checkout clean at bcf46976. However this is NOT ready for CODE-REVIEW because the fork explicitly left the existing Ctrl+J HotkeySmoke timing/artifact issue in place; user has rejected events.jsonl/sleep/shell-prefix proof. A follow-up must rewrite HotkeySmoke to pure tmux visual assertions before review.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T21:02:40.902Z
- Recorded fork run: old6yg7vwzl2
- Summary: Launched narrow stability-fix fork old6yg7vwzl2. Scope: rewrite HotkeySmoke Ctrl+J E2E to pure real tmux visual editor-state proof (`Hello <hex>` → Ctrl+J → `World <hex>` visible on separate editor lines while still editing), with no events.jsonl, no sleeps, no shell-prefix, no LLM/session artifacts. Also ensure `/hotkeys` E2E asserts visible themed box table via tmux capture/snapshot only. Fork must remove residual flaky artifact code/comments, run repeated `castor test:tui --filter=HotkeySmoke`, full `castor test:tui`, focused hotkey tests, deptrac/phpstan/cs-check, commit, and leave worktree clean.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T21:12:37.061Z
- Recorded fork run: old6yg7vwzl2
- Validation: Fork old6yg7vwzl2 validation: `castor test:tui --filter=HotkeySmoke` passed three consecutive times (2 tests, 18 assertions each run); Fork old6yg7vwzl2 validation: full `castor test:tui` passed (13 tests, 48 assertions); Fork old6yg7vwzl2 validation: focused hotkey/slash/completion tests passed (117 tests, 261 assertions); Fork old6yg7vwzl2 validation: full `castor test` passed (2313 tests, 6788 assertions); Fork old6yg7vwzl2 validation: `castor deptrac` passed (0 violations), `castor phpstan` passed (0 errors), `castor cs-check` clean; Orchestrator verification: `git show --stat HEAD` shows 2 files changed (+109/-140): HotkeyTableRenderer.php and HotkeySmokeTest.php; task worktree status clean
- Summary: Stability-fix fork old6yg7vwzl2 completed at commit 664e809b. HotkeySmoke E2E tests were rewritten to be deterministic and purely visual. Ctrl+J proof now types two unique markers, sends C-j, stays in the editor without submitting, polls tmux capture via waitForCallback, and asserts the markers appear on separate visible editor lines. `/hotkeys` proof types `/hotkeys`, presses Enter, and asserts visible themed box table content/box drawing chars in tmux capture. Removed events.jsonl assertions, fixed sleeps, glob/session artifact dependency, shell-prefix command workaround, SafeGuard config, and LLM response waiting from these tests. HotkeyTableRenderer also had a border alignment fix. Orchestrator verified task worktree clean at 664e809b. Integration checkout currently has an unrelated `.pi/settings.json` modification, so it is not clean and was not touched.

- Recorded fork run: uu1qo3b48z9q
- Summary: Reviewer subagent returned REQUEST CHANGES for EDITOR-12 at HEAD 664e809b/f1fe4ac2 lineage. Blocking issue: HotkeyRegistry is a shared singleton populated by TuiListenerRegistrars on every session loop/session switch, so `/hotkeys` can accumulate duplicate bindings. Additional actionable findings: remove unused HotkeyProviderInterface dead abstraction, fix misleading InteractiveMode keybinding comment, document or type the SubmitListener array-shape adapter, de-duplicate empty-message ownership, consider table-width caps, and preserve/justify TUI E2E artifact retention. Launched review-fix fork uu1qo3b48z9q with exact instructions to address findings, keep theme-aware `/hotkeys`, preserve pure visual HotkeySmoke E2E, run Castor validation, commit, and leave worktree clean.

- Summary: Review-fix fork uu1qo3b48z9q completed at commit 4e7a02d0. Addressed reviewer findings: HotkeyRegistry now deduplicates repeated registrations and adds clear(); unused HotkeyProviderInterface removed; InteractiveMode keybinding comment corrected; HotkeyTableData empty-message ownership simplified; HotkeyTableRenderer width caps reduced to fit typical 120-col terminals; HotkeyRegistry tests added for dedup/clear behavior. E2E temp-dir cleanup intentionally skipped because project convention retains passing TUI snapshots under var/tmp/tui-e2e-* for inspection. Orchestrator verified task worktree clean at 4e7a02d0 and integration checkout clean at 210e6218.

Sensible actionable suggestions: add missing blank line before SubmitListener hotkey adapter section, clarify InteractiveMode Ctrl+J keybinding comment, and enforce HotkeyBindingDTO non-empty keys contract. Explicitly skipped not-worth-changing NTH suggestions: replacing serialize() hash and refactoring HotkeyTableRenderer branch duplication.

- Moved CODE-REVIEW → IN-PROGRESS.
- Summary: PR #114 review-iterate: user left one inline comment at config/services.yaml:223 asking whether explicit HotkeyRegistry service registration is needed or whether autowiring already handles it. User also noted maintenance task landed, so branch must sync with latest main and tests may need updates. Moving back to IN-PROGRESS to address PR comment, merge/rebase latest main, and validate.

- Summary: Launched PR review-iterate fork 021vafrvt41l for PR #114. Scope: fetch/rebase onto latest origin/main after maintenance task landed; address inline comment at config/services.yaml:223 asking whether explicit HotkeyRegistry service registration is needed or autowiring already handles it; remove redundant explicit service config if Symfony auto-registration provides a shared singleton, or keep with concise rationale only if necessary; update tests if maintenance changes require; preserve theme-aware `/hotkeys` and pure visual TmuxHarness HotkeySmoke; run Castor validation; commit and leave worktree clean.

- Summary: PR #114 review-iterate fork 021vafrvt41l completed at commit 7e90c7eb. Fork merged latest origin/main into the task branch cleanly after maintenance landed (merge commit beb4c54c) and removed the redundant explicit `Ineersa\Tui\Command\Hotkey\HotkeyRegistry: ~` service registration from config/services.yaml. Rationale: the `src/Tui/**/*.php` resource glob already auto-registers Tui classes as shared autowired services, so the explicit line was unnecessary. PR branch was pushed to origin and PR #114 updated. Orchestrator verified worktree clean at 7e90c7eb; integration checkout clean at 5af3e911. PR mergeStateStatus currently UNSTABLE on GitHub, so task-to-review will rely on local validation and move_task full Castor gate.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-10T22:24:42.344Z
- Summary: User instructed not to launch another reviewer for the small PR #114 comment fix. The previous reviewer had already approved the main implementation; the latest change only merged latest main and removed redundant explicit HotkeyRegistry service registration. Proceeding without further reviewer, with Castor validation and move_task quality gate only.

- Recorded fork run: h37ng9no7c5l
- Summary: move_task back to CODE-REVIEW was manually stopped by user because the Castor quality gate appeared to hang/take too long; task remains IN-PROGRESS at HEAD 7e90c7eb. Launched diagnostic validation fork h37ng9no7c5l to inspect latest origin/main/maintenance commits for test/check behavior changes, run `LLM_MODE=true castor check`, isolate any hanging sub-step via Castor constituent commands if needed, verify HotkeySmoke/focused hotkey paths, and either commit a clear small branch-specific fix or report exact blocker evidence. No reviewer requested; no task moves/push/PR changes from fork.

- Summary: Diagnostic Castor-check fork h37ng9no7c5l completed at commit 4dc63017. Root cause of apparent gate hang was introduced by the latest maintenance merge: `.castor/tasks.php` parallelized check steps via `run_commands_parallel()` but the helper had no internal timeout, so a stuck child process could spin forever until move_task's outer OS timeout. Fork added an optional per-process timeout to `run_commands_parallel()` and passes 300s from `run_check_commands_parallel()`. No EDITOR-12 production code changed. Orchestrator verified worktree clean at 4dc63017 and branch ahead of origin by 1.

- Recorded fork run: 1o9mdpeq3zm1
- Summary: Retrying move_task after Castor parallel timeout fix completed the gate but failed only `test:tui` (exit code 2). Failure is not HotkeySmoke; JUnit shows `TuiAgentSmokeTest::testNewSessionCommandAndGetAssistantResponse` timed out waiting 10s for a new user block (`❯`) after `/new` prompt submission. Last capture showed the second prompt visible in the editor/input area with idle status but no new user transcript block. Launched narrow diagnostic/fix fork 1o9mdpeq3zm1 to inspect TuiAgentSmokeTest/TmuxHarness/failure artifacts and maintenance-merge timing changes, fix the smallest deterministic issue without sleeps, preserve HotkeySmoke guarantees, run Castor TUI/full check validation, commit, and leave worktree clean.

- Recorded fork run: 1o9mdpeq3zm1
- Validation: Fork 1o9mdpeq3zm1 validation: `castor test:tui --filter=HotkeySmoke|testNewSessionCommand` passed (3 tests, 20 assertions); Fork 1o9mdpeq3zm1 validation: full `castor test:tui` passed (13 tests, 48 assertions); Fork 1o9mdpeq3zm1 validation: focused Hotkey/Slash/Completion tests passed (99 tests, 229 assertions); Fork 1o9mdpeq3zm1 validation: `castor deptrac` passed (0 violations), `castor phpstan` passed (0 errors), `castor cs-check` clean
- Summary: TUI gate failure diagnostic/fix fork 1o9mdpeq3zm1 completed at commit d28e507c. Root cause: maintenance merge parallelized all `castor check` steps, causing `test:controller`, `test:llm-real`, and `test:tui` to hit the same llama_cpp_test/test server on port 9052 concurrently. This created LLM resource contention; `TuiAgentSmokeTest::testNewSessionCommandAndGetAssistantResponse` timed out waiting for a user block after `/new` despite passing reliably in isolation. Fix: `.castor/tasks.php` now runs non-LLM/static steps in parallel (`deptrac`, `test`, `phpstan`, `cs-check`) and LLM-dependent steps sequentially (`test:controller`, `test:llm-real`, `test:tui`) while retaining the 300s per-process timeout from 4dc63017. No EDITOR-12 production code changed. Orchestrator verified task worktree clean at d28e507c, ahead of origin branch by 2; integration checkout clean at 17fe8e5c.

- Summary: Revert-only fork g945ykure7l1 completed at commit be512fcf. It reverted the two Castor/test-execution commits (`4dc63017` and `d28e507c`) via a single revert commit `be512fcf`, preserving EDITOR-12 changes and the HotkeyRegistry service-registration cleanup. Orchestrator verified only git state/diff: `.castor/tasks.php` has no diff vs origin/main, PR diff excluding .castor still contains only the 19 EDITOR-12 files (+1743/-16), task worktree is clean and ahead of origin/task/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke by 3. No tests or Castor commands were run by the fork or orchestrator after the user's explicit instruction not to touch test execution.

- Recorded fork run: u673gr9aw3eq
- Summary: Launched review-iterate validation fork u673gr9aw3eq per user request. Scope: merge latest origin/main into task branch (merge, not rebase), read testing skill plus AGENTS/tests AGENTS/docs/tui-testing guidance, update tests only if latest main requires it, preserve deterministic HotkeySmoke TmuxHarness proof, run Castor validation gates including `LLM_MODE=true castor check`, and leave worktree clean. Hard guardrail: do not modify Castor/test-execution infrastructure (`.castor/tasks.php`, parallelization, check scheduling); previous Castor changes remain reverted and `.castor/tasks.php` must stay matching origin/main unless origin/main changed it.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-11T17:29:04.226Z

- Summary: Validation/merge fork u673gr9aw3eq completed at HEAD faf6105b. It read testing guidance (`.agents/skills/testing/SKILL.md`, `tests/AGENTS.md`, `docs/tui-testing.md`), fetched and merged latest origin/main via merge commit eee2189b (origin/main 118a37a7), preserved EDITOR-12 changes, and kept `.castor/tasks.php` identical to origin/main with no task-branch Castor/test-execution infrastructure changes. One post-merge test update was needed: `tests/Tui/E2E/ShellPrefixSmokeTest.php` increased the LLM response marker wait from 5s to 15s because MAINT-02 reduced TUI waits aggressively and ShellPrefix was failing under parallel Castor check load while the response appeared around 6–7s. Fork committed fix faf6105b. Orchestrator verified worktree clean at faf6105b, branch ahead of origin/task by 43, `.castor/tasks.php` diff vs origin/main empty, and PR diff contains 20 files (+1744/-17).

Branch merged origin/main 118a37a7 via eee2189b, kept `.castor/tasks.php` identical to origin/main with no task-branch Castor/test-execution infrastructure changes, preserved EDITOR-12 changes and HotkeyRegistry service cleanup, and added one post-merge test adaptation in `ShellPrefixSmokeTest.php` increasing the LLM response marker wait from 5s to 15s after MAINT-02 timeout reductions. Fork validation passed focused TUI, full TUI, full tests, deptrac, phpstan, cs-check, and `LLM_MODE=true castor check` (all 13 parallel steps green in 1m10s). Moving to CODE-REVIEW to run normal gate, push branch, and update PR #114.

Scope: lower `ShellPrefixSmokeTest::waitForLlmResponse()` assistant marker wait from 15s back to 5s and run validation; only if 5s demonstrates flakiness, raise to 8s maximum and validate. Hard guardrails: no Castor/test-execution infrastructure changes, no sleeps, preserve deterministic TmuxHarness behavior, commit and leave worktree clean.

- Summary: Timeout review-iterate fork 67uly66th0nw completed at commit 40639634. It read testing guidance, lowered `ShellPrefixSmokeTest::waitForLlmResponse()` assistant marker timeout from 15s back to 5s, validated, and reproduced the flake under parallel load: after `!ls -1` completed and status cleared, submitting `Say exactly: hello` left the TUI in `◐ Working...` with no `◇` or `✕` within 5s. Per user's instruction, fork raised only to 8s maximum. 8s passes focused ShellPrefix, full TUI, and full `LLM_MODE=true castor check`. No Castor/test-execution infrastructure changed; orchestrator verified `.castor/tasks.php` diff vs origin/main is empty, worktree clean at 40639634, branch ahead of origin/task by 1.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-12T00:26:11.586Z
- Moved CODE-REVIEW → IN-PROGRESS.
- Summary: PR #114 blocker: user reports `castor check` can hang indefinitely after recent maintenance/test changes. This is now critical test-infrastructure/test-timeout work: tests must fail with proper timeouts and no uncapped waits. Moving back to IN-PROGRESS to scout all uncapped timeout paths and fix test timeout issues before returning to review.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-12T00:39:54.365Z
- Recorded fork run: n1quu8reb70t
- Summary: Critical test hang investigation: relaunched scouts and read their combined report from `/home/ineersa/.pi/agent/tmp/2026-06--faa7d82a.txt`. Key findings: `castor check` step commands are timeout-wrapped but TUI test support has uncapped tmux `shell_exec`/`exec` calls in `TmuxHarness`; `TuiStartupSnapshotTest` appends `exec sleep 3600`, which can leave hour-long tmux orphan sessions if teardown is skipped; TmuxHarness polling loops themselves are deadline-based; controller E2E loops are mostly bounded; do not follow stale-dir cleanup recommendations because tests/AGENTS.md requires preserving TUI E2E artifacts. Launched implementation fork n1quu8reb70t to fix high-confidence tests/test-support uncapped waits only, with hard guardrail not to modify `.castor/tasks.php` or Castor/check scheduling. Required fixes: bounded tmux command helper in `TmuxHarness`, remove/replace the one-hour startup snapshot sleep, preserve snapshot artifact retention, validate with focused/full TUI, castor test/deptrac/phpstan/cs-check, and `LLM_MODE=true castor check`.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-12T00:49:41.011Z
- Recorded fork run: vlon1dgjztk7
- Summary: Retrieved failed fork n1quu8reb70t artifact despite signal_aborted. It committed `fa59b661`: bounded all TmuxHarness tmux shell calls with Symfony Process timeouts (5s normal/capture/send, 10s session start), changed TuiStartupSnapshotTest from `exec sleep 3600` to bounded `exec sleep 10`, updated startup snapshot, kept `.castor/tasks.php` unchanged, and full `castor test:tui` passed. Its `LLM_MODE=true timeout 90 castor check` completed without hanging but failed `test:llm-real` at OutputCapReadFileControllerTest because read `tool_execution.completed` never arrived before timeout; fork dismissed that as known flaky. User rejected that: OutputCap flake MUST be fixed. Relaunched fork vlon1dgjztk7 on worktree HEAD `fa59b661` with explicit scope to reproduce, diagnose, and fix OutputCapReadFileControllerTest under `test:llm-real`/`castor check` while preserving TUI timeout fixes and not touching Castor/check infrastructure.

- Recorded fork run: vlon1dgjztk7
- Validation: castor test:llm-real --filter=OutputCapReadFileControllerTest (3 consecutive focused runs): OK (1 test, 11 assertions each); castor test:tui: OK (16 tests, 51 assertions, ~64s standalone; ~68.3s under check, below 75s step timeout); castor deptrac: OK (0 violations); castor phpstan: OK (0 errors); castor cs-check: OK (0 files fixed); LLM_MODE=true castor check: OK / quality: ok, all 13 steps green; test:llm-real OK (5 tests, 51 assertions), test:tui OK (16 tests, 51 assertions)
- Summary: Fork vlon1dgjztk7 completed at commit `cb537632` on branch `task/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke`; worktree verified clean. It fixed the remaining blocker by reverting the Process-based TmuxHarness wrapper added in `fa59b661` back to direct `shell_exec()` polling because the Symfony Process per-call overhead in tmux polling loops slowed `test:tui` enough under parallel LLM load to create cascading `test:llm-real`/OutputCap timeouts. It preserved the bounded `TuiStartupSnapshotTest` pane-keeper change (`exec sleep 3600` -> `exec sleep 10`) from the prior fork and updated the startup golden snapshot. Exact delta from prior fork: `tests/Tui/E2E/TmuxHarness.php` and `tests/Tui/Snapshots/startup-120x40.txt` only. Verified in worktree: HEAD `cb537632`, branch `task/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke`, clean status, and no diff for `.castor/tasks.php`, `.castor/helpers.php`, or `castor.php` versus `origin/main`. Fork reports OutputCapReadFileControllerTest was not a production/test logic bug: it passed focused and under full `castor check` once TUI polling overhead was removed; `collectEventsUntilToolCompleted('read', 5.0)` and prompt are already explicit and deterministic.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-12T01:05:14.058Z
- Recorded fork run: 10r3osnq68d7
- Summary: Although fork vlon1dgjztk7 made `LLM_MODE=true castor check` green at `cb537632`, orchestrator rejected it as final because it reintroduced uncapped `shell_exec()` tmux calls in `TmuxHarness`, conflicting with the user’s hard requirement that tests must fail with proper timeouts and have no uncapped waits. Launched follow-up fork 10r3osnq68d7 to preserve OutputCap/check stability while replacing TmuxHarness shell calls with a low-overhead bounded direct `proc_open()` helper (not Symfony Process, which previous fork measured as too slow in polling loops). Guardrails: do not touch Castor/check infrastructure, keep `exec sleep 10` bounded startup pane keeper, preserve TUI artifact retention, keep ShellPrefix timeout <=8s, validate focused/full TUI, repeated OutputCap, full llm-real, deptrac/phpstan/cs-check, and full `LLM_MODE=true castor check`.

- Summary: Fork 10r3osnq68d7 completed at commit `3d09e743`; worktree verified clean on branch `task/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke`. It replaces uncapped TmuxHarness `shell_exec()`/`exec()` paths with a low-overhead direct `proc_open()` deadline helper, avoiding the prior Symfony Process overhead while satisfying the hard no-uncapped-waits requirement. Timeout strategy: 2s for `isAvailable()`/`paneExists()`, 5s for capture/send/cleanup commands, 10s for session start; cleanup/destructor paths are bounded and non-throwing, active operations throw clear errors on timeout. It preserves `TuiStartupSnapshotTest`'s bounded `exec sleep 10` pane keeper and keeps ShellPrefix LLM wait at 8s. Exact changed files from previous commit: `tests/Tui/E2E/TmuxHarness.php` and `tests/Tui/Snapshots/startup-120x40.txt`. Verified no diff for `.castor/tasks.php`, `.castor/helpers.php`, or `castor.php` versus `origin/main`. Branch is ready for CODE-REVIEW update/push when requested.

- Recorded fork run: xj15ax4myylt
- Summary: Fork xj15ax4myylt completed at commit `40168e0c`; worktree verified clean. User explicitly approved moving Castor `test:tui` check step timeout from 75s to 90s. Change is one line in `.castor/tasks.php`: `test:tui` timeout `75` -> `90`. Rationale: PHPUnit TUI suite completed successfully around 70s, but the 75s OS wrapper was too tight once startup/teardown overhead is included; 90s provides headroom while keeping the step bounded. Previous TmuxHarness bounded `proc_open()` timeout helper and OutputCap stability fixes remain intact.

- Summary: Moved back to CODE-REVIEW after fixing test hang/flakiness blockers.

- Summary: Post-merge completion for EDITOR-12: task branch merged into main via move_task; task moved to DONE; task worktree cleanup completed. `move_task` removed the git worktree but left a non-git leftover directory containing only `var/tmp`; verified it was not listed by `git worktree list` and had no `.git`, then removed `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/editor-12-keybindings-docs-smoke`. Integration checkout is clean and synced with origin/main. Note: pre-existing local `.pi/settings.json` change was stashed before merge as `stash@{0}: On main: pre-editor-12-done-local-pi-settings` to satisfy clean merge requirements; it remains in stash and was not reapplied so main stays clean.
