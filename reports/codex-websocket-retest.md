# Cached Codex WebSocket retest

Investigation date: 2026-09-22. Task: `2026-09-08-retest-and-stabilize-cached-codex-websocket-transport`.

## Finding and fix

The direct transport probe passed, but an actual controller session reproduced a continuation defect. Cached connections were reused while every normal assistant turn and tool result sent full history with `reason=divergent_input`.

`CodexWebSocketContinuationComparator` compared JSON encodings literally. Provider output contains fields that `CodexContract` does not replay, and the normalizers emit object keys in a different order. Tool arguments also pass through JSON decoding and encoding. Feeding raw provider items directly into the next request, as the first probe did, bypassed these differences.

The fix compares equivalent history representations without changing transmitted items:

- Object key order does not affect equality. List order still matters.
- Assistant message comparison excludes `id`, `status`, and `phase`, which the assistant normalizer omits. Output-text comparison excludes `annotations` and `logprobs`.
- Function-call comparison excludes `status` and compares parsed arguments. Call identity remains significant.
- Changed assistant text, tool arguments, call IDs, or input order still reject continuation.

No retry, transport default, setting, API, or persistence behavior changed. The cached transport remains opt-in.

## Revisions and setup

| Investigation | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| Direct cached versus plain baseline | `2715f242b62be7500850a56751a1923db4ee1da4` |
| Application-level failing baseline | `b72f80cc81b9d06674fe06739a46364224e0c66f` |
| Fixed implementation and deterministic tests | `102d2175edcddf4bba570de1acf6813be7cde0eb` |

The fixed controller probe ran against the production code subsequently committed as `102d2175e`. Later report/comment edits do not change that behavior.

Probes used the real Codex WebSocket endpoint under ignored `var/tmp/codex-probe/`. The application probe launched an isolated controller with production provider construction, one LLM worker, one tool worker, and `read` only. Auth/settings/sessions outside that tree were untouched. Controller shutdown used stdin EOF; both lifetimes stopped eight owned processes with zero survivors.

## Application-level before and after

The same short conversation exercised an initial answer, a real read-tool loop, process stop/resume, cancellation on a positive text delta, and a subsequent turn.

| Stage | Failing baseline | Fixed observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial answer | Full context, two input items | Same; one completed run |
| Next user turn | Reused socket, four input items, no previous response ID | Reused socket, one user item, previous response ID |
| Tool result | Reused socket, six input items, no previous response ID | Reused socket, only `function_call_output`, previous response ID; tool and run completed |
| Stop and resume | Fresh connection, full history | Fresh connection, eight input items, no previous response ID; run completed |
| Cancel during streaming | Cancellation completed | Cancel sent after `assistant.text_delta`; `cancellation.requested`, `turn.cancelled`, and `run.cancelled` observed; cached entry invalidated |
| Turn after cancellation | Probe used the wrong command | `follow_up` completed on a fresh connection with 11 full-history items and no previous response ID |

Resume was not simulated with a provider option. The first controller and its workers exited. A second controller opened the same isolated project and received the JSONL `resume` command, followed by a user message. This is the attach path used by `JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient` for CLI/TUI resume. `ResumeHandler` called `InProcessAgentSessionClient::attach`, emitted `run.resumed`, and reset the reasoning epoch. No TUI was launched.

Every final application stage reported zero error-level log records. Cancellation was synchronized on a streaming event, not a delay.

## Requirement-to-proof map

| Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Cached versus plain baseline | Direct two-turn comparison: plain opened two sockets; cached opened one and sent a one-item delta. Application baseline then exposed the normalization gap. |
| Multi-turn and tool-loop correctness | Fixed controller run emitted one real tool execution and completed the subsequent model turn. Both eligible requests sent one-item deltas. Direct probe additionally checked requested tool name/arguments, unique output-item IDs, consecutive output indexes, and one created/completed response per request. |
| Astra baseline and updates | Direct probe held low baseline, changed to medium, repeated unchanged medium, and returned to low. Cached input counts were `1,2,1,2`; five requests used one socket versus five for plain. Existing transition-hook tests cover normalizer/history placement. |
| Resume and model changes | Actual controller process restart and attach established fresh continuation. Direct Astra-to-catalog-model `gpt-5.6-luna` comparison opened a new socket and sent full history for both transports. |
| Cancellation and later requests | Actual cancellation after text streaming invalidated the cache; a subsequent `follow_up` completed on a new connection. |
| Disconnect and expiry | Direct probe closed its owned socket and separately advanced the cache's injected clock two hours. Later requests used fresh sockets and full history. Deterministic cache tests cover idle TTL and maximum age; interrupted-continuation tests cover peer EOF. |
| Rejected continuation | Deliberately absent response ID produced an error and closed the socket. A distinct next request completed without continuation. The committed interruption test checks rejection of an established delta and forbids implicit resend. |
| Socket and worker ownership | Direct probes' opened/closed socket counts matched. Both real controller process trees stopped on EOF with zero survivors. Worker diagnostics found no stale QA candidates. |
| Deterministic regression | Two contract-backed continuation-state tests failed with a null delta before the fix and passed afterward. Negative assertions preserve text, argument, call-ID, and list-order distinctions. |

## Commands and results

Temporary live probes ran from ignored `var/tmp/codex-probe/` Castor tasks (`astra`, `tool`, `lifecycle`, `model`, `rejection`, `shape`, plus `controller-probe`). The final controller probe passed. Sanitized local outputs stayed under that ignored tree. Probe safety caps were positive-event waits, not production timeout increases, and no blind retries or sleep windows were used.

Committed validation:

```sh
castor test --filter=testNormalizedAssistantHistoryContinuesNativeResponseWithoutReplayingIt
castor test --filter=testNormalizedToolHistoryContinuesNativeResponseWithoutReplayingCall
castor test --filter='Codex.*Test|RawWebSocketResultTest|ResultConverterWebSocketTest|SessionAwareModelResolverTest|AstraReasoningTransition.*Test'
castor phpstan
castor deptrac
castor test:llm-real --filter=LlamaCppSmokeTest
castor cs-check
castor clean:cleanup:workers:list
```

Both new regressions failed before the fix. The final focused suite passed with 252 tests and 953 assertions. Maximum individual case was 0.407323 seconds; new normalization cases were at most 0.000336 seconds. PHPStan, Deptrac, style, and the local llama.cpp smoke passed. Worker diagnostics found no stale QA candidates. The llama.cpp smoke is separate from the real Codex evidence.

## Probe corrections and limits

The original direct probe incorrectly required populated terminal `response.output`. The endpoint emits empty terminal output while `response.output_item.done` carries text and tool items. Correcting that probe assumption verified the existing fallback; it was not a new product fix.

An exploratory request used `gpt-5.3-codex`, which is absent from this checkout's catalog, and failed for both transports. The catalog-backed `gpt-5.6-luna` model change passed. The original post-cancel controller command was `user_message`, which maps to steering and did not start a new cancelled run. Using the supported `follow_up` command resolved that probe error without a runtime change.

Bounded correctness evidence only. One LLM worker, no TUI. Provider-enforced expiry and live loss of a previously valid continuation were not forced; clock-driven expiry and deliberate rejection cover client behavior. No contention failure reproduced. Full `castor check` and independent review remain later gates.

## Interactive Sol observation

A subsequent tmux run at `df1f2fd36130e070c8c4096855bb5739499576c4` launched the actual interactive TUI with cached `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`, low reasoning, and isolated HOME, CWD, databases, auth, and sessions:

```sh
castor --castor-file=var/tmp/codex-probe/castor.php tui-probe
```

Sol was available. The first answer sent three full-context items. The second answer reused the socket with a one-user-item continuation. A real read-tool loop then sent one user item and one `function_call_output`, both with `previous_response_id`. The terminal showed completed answers and the tool result. Canonical events recorded three completed runs and exactly one completed tool execution. Those stages had no error-level log records.

The cancellation observation barrier failed because it required the first two numbered output lines to remain visible together. The failure snapshot instead shows generated integers 117–156 and `Working...`, so output was progressing. Escape was never sent. The probe exited through the normal Ctrl+D action, without external termination signals. This run does **not** prove TUI cancellation, a post-cancel request, or TUI resume. Work stopped rather than repeating the long output journey.

The probe tracked only one pane PID, not the full worker tree. Pane exit and a clean `castor clean:cleanup:workers:list` result do not establish complete worker teardown for this TUI run. Earlier controller-level ownership proof remains separate. The isolated project and credentials were removed.

Ignored inspection artifacts:

- `var/tmp/codex-probe/tui-sol.log`: sanitized event counts and transport summaries.
- `var/reports/codex-tui-sol/`: plain snapshots `startup.txt`, `first-answer.txt`, `second-answer.txt`, `read-tool.txt`, and `final-or-failure.txt`.

## Harbor evaluation preflight

The first Harbor attempt stopped before any model request. Blockers were a missing current native artifact, an unmatched SPC cache key, and adapter teardown that signaled process groups after setting `HATFIELD_SESSION_ID`. Those blockers were resolved in the next approved section. No verifier or transport metrics exist for this blocked preflight.

## Approved native build and one Harbor trial

After explicit approval, the native-build and adapter blockers above were resolved. The single paid trial completed the agent run, but its verifier failed before running tests. No second trial was attempted.

### Build and adapter provenance

- Native executable: task worktree `var/tmp/dist/hatfield.linux-amd64`, embedded commit `777ed88a750a0eab7a376f1b840e6c721b2146bb`.
- Native SHA-256: `7077e3d1254f94d2e7a0d959d7992050089e6a161202db152fbf9a30e813c679`.
- PHAR SHA-256: `b6474612100e8d5ad9d3f0d303431156c8e9507645693c70fa0bbe6960ba7ec5`.
- Harbor commits: `266b4cf25dbab492ab8323e2bd056fa8380280a6` replaces process-group signals with bounded stdin-EOF shutdown and removes inherited session tags from new children; `5512c64d0c24415b677d3d6a69e17d58ee46efcd` makes the retained log directory writable by the configured non-root agent.

Build prerequisites stayed under ignored `var/tmp/static-tools`. `castor distribution:build-static` and `castor distribution:verify` passed. Harbor install smoke reported the same embedded commit before model execution.

The adapter now refuses root execution. EOF shutdown waits for live members of the owned controller session, drains stdout, records survivor counts, and raises on failure without sending signals. Existing normal/error artifact preservation remains in place. Harbor's deterministic suite passed: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest --durations=5`, 19 tests in 0.37 seconds, maximum case 0.07 seconds. New tests cover a real controller/worker EOF handshake and a loud shutdown failure with signals forbidden. The main-path test verifies an enclosing `HATFIELD_SESSION_ID` does not reach the child.

### Trial and results

Job: `hatfield-harbor/jobs/codex-cached-20260922`, trial `scikit-learn__scikit-learn-10297__2RYxEoC`.

The downloaded registry task resolved to the expected original digest `sha256:99b7fc2ffa0f8b2d2c7e9691991ea3d607899e37203a582b5342e306dfedc090`. Its ignored local copy changed only `agent.user` and Dockerfile ownership setup to run as `hatfield-eval`. Instruction, solution, and verifier files were unchanged. Harbor recorded local task digest `sha256:edef2bf6d698c0719dbb34f483be002f2f10be9981d4795a32ad17c92458c0cc`.

The run used `harbor run -p jobs/cached-preflight/tasks/scikit-learn__scikit-learn-10297 -a hatfield_harbor.agent:HatfieldHarborAgent -m openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna -n 1 -k 1 --max-retries 0 --agent-timeout-multiplier 0.1 --verifier-timeout-multiplier 0.2 --job-name codex-cached-20260922 -o jobs`, with explicit executable, settings, access-only auth, commit, and `reasoning=medium` agent kwargs. Agent time was bounded to 300 seconds; verifier time to 600 seconds. Isolated settings selected cached WebSocket, disabled model retries, used one LLM worker, and retained structured logs through `logging.path=/logs/agent/hatfield-logs`.

| Observation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Agent terminal | `run.completed`; 14 LLM steps |
| Tools | 15 calls: 4 bash, 7 edit, 4 read; 11 completed, 4 failed |
| Cached transport | 1 created connection, 13 reuses, 13 continuation deltas, 1 initial full-context request |
| Transport failures | No divergent-input fallback, I/O error, timeout, or error-level log entry |
| Shutdown | `session_close` cache reset and worker shutdown logged; 8 observed processes, 0 survivors |
| Duration | Agent 88.86 seconds; total 118.29 seconds |
| Usage | 160,835 input tokens, 121,856 cache-read tokens, 3,249 output tokens, 875 thinking tokens |
| Cost | $0.0759086 from canonical usage accounting, not an invoice |
| Verifier | No reward. `RewardFileNotFoundError`; issue and regression tests did not run |

The verifier's first Git checkout failed with `fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/testbed'`. The required non-root overlay made the agent own `/testbed`, while the unchanged verifier ran as root. This is an evaluation-environment failure, not a model failure or cached-transport failure. A future approved attempt needs a scoped Git trust/ownership correction for the verifier. The trial was not rerun to obtain a score.

Trial evidence stayed under the Harbor job's `agent/` and `verifier/` directories. The privacy-safe aggregate is `jobs/cached-preflight/report.json`. Owned containers were removed, the access-only auth copy was deleted after a zero-match credential scan, and worker diagnostics found no stale QA candidates.

## Fixed candidate suite, stopped after task four

The user authorized the existing ten-task set, then requested stopping after tasks three and four. Exactly four fresh attempts ran, sequentially; the other six did not run. The earlier single trial is excluded. Harbor revision was `1a5d9564702e8f612968877642b7b94079ea2a45`. The native artifact and production code remained unchanged from the preceding experiment.

The non-root overlay now trusts exactly `/testbed` inside each container and checks Git as root and as the agent before model execution. Verifier scripts also passed shell syntax checks. Frozen task manifests record original registry digests, overlay hashes, and unchanged instruction/verifier/solution hashes. No host Git trust setting changed. Agent and verifier budgets were each 600 seconds; model and Harbor retries were zero.

| Task | Verifier | Requests | Delta / full | Cached input | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| astropy 14182 | Pass | 8 | 6 / 2 | 72.40% | $0.054152 |
| django 15128 | Pass | 22 | 19 / 3 | 82.44% | $0.119786 |
| matplotlib 24870 | Fail | 15 | 14 / 1 | 75.22% | $0.084104 |
| seaborn 3069 | Fail | 14 | 12 / 2 | 76.78% | $0.090748 |

All four agents reached `run.completed`; there were no trial exceptions or transport errors/timeouts/retries. All 450 selected regression tests passed. Matplotlib failed its one issue-specific test; seaborn passed one and failed one. These are model task failures, not the previous verifier setup failure.

Weighted prompt-cache usage was **78.11%**, calculated as 581,632 cached input tokens divided by 744,602 input tokens. Fifty of 59 requests reported cached tokens. Total cost was $0.3487892 and summed trial time was 677.81 seconds. These are usage-derived costs, not invoices.

Four sockets served 59 requests: 51 deltas, four initial full-context requests, and four post-edit `divergent_input` fallbacks. The original item mismatch was not retained. Those fallbacks still reported 83.22–93.05% cached input, while some deltas reported zero cache reads. Prompt-cache reads and WebSocket continuation measure different things.

There were 78 tool calls, including 13 successful edits and eight bash `ToolCallException` results. Every controller recorded eight observed processes and zero shutdown survivors. No owned containers remained; the private auth copy was removed after a zero-match credential scan.

The sanitized report is `reports/swe-bench-cached-2026-09-22.json` in the separate `hatfield-harbor` repository. Raw local diagnostics remain under its ignored `jobs/cached-suite-20260922/`; preparation and frozen hashes are under `jobs/cached-suite-prepared/`. Its repeatable procedure is `docs/cached-candidate-suite.md`. Deterministic Harbor validation passed 22 tests, maximum case 0.07 seconds. This four-task sample is not a complete ten-task benchmark or proof of every transport lifecycle.

## Plain WebSocket GPT-6 Luna control (2026-09-23)

Goal: compare provider prompt-cache reads for Django `django__django-15128` and Matplotlib `matplotlib__matplotlib-24870` on plain `websocket` with `openai-codex/gpt-6-luna` / medium against the earlier GPT-5.6 Luna / `websocket-cached` suite. Model and transport both changed, so this is not a transport causality verdict.

Native artifact: `var/tmp/dist/hatfield.linux-amd64` embeds `be805cdf716936cab4b17b08d5ebab755daa8431`, SHA-256 `7d9f61a580d603cbaa4ae9b836422cf00c75f96ab8a2e4635c2381bb67ea363d`. The full `castor distribution:build-static` failed while rebuilding `micro.sfx` (`make: No rule to make target 'micro'`). A fresh PHAR was combined with the previously verified `micro.sfx`, and `castor distribution:verify` passed. Settings: Harbor `configs/gpt6-luna-medium-plain.yaml`.

First Django trial `django__django-15128__uvWSuLX` failed before any LLM step because the access-only auth JSON omitted the `refresh` key. `CodexAuthRecord::fromArray` requires `access`, `refresh`, and `accountId`. Token-free proof confirmed `refresh: ""` parses and persists; an expired empty refresh attempts refresh and fails. Corrected access-only auth used `CodexAuthStorage::saveCredentials` with an empty refresh string.

Corrected trials (new job path `jobs/plain-gpt6-luna-20260923-retry`):

| Task | Trial | LLM steps | Cache read % | Post-hit zero-cache drops | previous_response_id | Verifier | Teardown |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Django | `django__django-15128__BGJNGFE` | 9 | 72.48 | 0 | 0/9 | fail: 1 issue test, 25 regression tests | 8 proc / 0 survivors |
| Matplotlib | `matplotlib__matplotlib-24870__qSbMDnP` | 12 | 76.34 | 0 | 0/12 | fail: 1 issue test; 65 regression tests pass | 8 proc / 0 survivors |

Only request #1 was zero-cache in each plain trial. Baseline cached-websocket post-hit zeros remain Django #19 (18880 input) and Matplotlib #3/#8 (4950 / 15255). No request retries. Private auth removed after a zero-match credential scan. Owned containers gone. No stale QA workers.

Sanitized Harbor report: `hatfield-harbor/reports/swe-bench-plain-gpt6-luna-2026-09-23.json`.

## Cached GPT-5.6 Luna diagnostic rerun (2026-09-23)

Goal: gather privacy-safe per-request `prompt_cache_key` fingerprints and structural continuation mismatch reasons, then rerun Django 15128 and Matplotlib 24870 once each on GPT-5.6 Luna / medium / `websocket-cached`.

Product change: `decide()` classifies `divergent_body`, `prefix_mismatch`, `prefix_shorter`, and `invalid_input`. Logs keep the same field names; `prompt_cache_key_fp` is emitted only for canonical UUIDv7 keys, and item kinds are limited to a fixed vocabulary. No raw key/prompt/provider payload is logged. Wire behavior is unchanged.

Native artifact used for the live diagnostic run: `var/tmp/dist/hatfield.linux-amd64` embeds `2c1392f42240d6e2839a56df7722e67be9475dac`, SHA-256 `33dbd40145eceedceefc332cea0f83b61d8bd658d9f2d0ae8fc1e2f8d67a4080` (pre-privacy-hardening). Later privacy hardening did not rebuild or rerun. Harbor revision `9b7529eb3ab10f814b2e8fa74af86e2b828bc407` accepts the new full-context reasons.

| Task | Trial | LLM steps | Cache read % | Post-hit zero-cache drops | previous_response_id | Full-context reasons | Verifier | Teardown |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Django | `django__django-15128__b4xypRQ` | 15 | 78.34 | 1 (#7) | 14/15 | `no_continuation`×1 | fail: 1 regression | 8 / 0 |
| Matplotlib | `matplotlib__matplotlib-24870__cCVKz5z` | 11 | 83.79 | 0 | 9/11 | `no_continuation`×1, `prefix_mismatch`×1 (`reasoning`/`reasoning` at index 24) | fail: 1 issue test; 65 regression pass | 8 / 0 |

Each trial kept one stable `prompt_cache_key_fp` with `prompt_cache_key_changed=false` on every turn. Django #7 was a successful delta with `previous_response_id` and zero cached tokens after strong hits on #5/#6; #8 recovered to 93.48%. Matplotlib had no post-hit zero-cache drop; its one non-initial full-context request was an explicit prefix mismatch on reasoning items, then deltas resumed with high cache reads.

Sanitized local Harbor report: `reports/swe-bench-cached-gpt56-luna-diag-2026-09-23.json` (ignored). Raw diagnostics: `jobs/diag-cached-gpt56-20260923/` (ignored). Private auth removed after a zero-match credential scan. No owned containers remained.

## Reasoning prefix-mismatch field diagnostics (2026-09-23)

Goal: identify the first differing field and baseline source when reasoning items reject cached continuation. Run one Matplotlib and, if necessary, one Seaborn GPT-5.6 Luna / medium / `websocket-cached` trial.

`describePrefixMismatch()` logs a bounded field path and value kinds. The baseline event compares output sources when counts match. Logs omit IDs, keys, prompts, ciphertext, and tool content.

Expired isolated auth stopped `38XADPq` before the LLM. Matplotlib `Z2dd5DQ` ran 14 steps without a mismatch, before baseline-source logging.

The trial binary embeds `b7cd9e5c7`, SHA-256 `2fa2db625e64f4444e64266fc0ba39d647a3199a0889323e12734fd0991f3b4a`. A fresh PHAR and verified `micro.sfx` passed `castor distribution:verify`; full rebuild lacked `re2c`, `flex`, and `gperf`.

Seaborn `wBtjmv6` and `MWR8sCy` exposed a replay bug. Each preceding response held two finalized reasoning items, but history kept only the last signature while the cached baseline kept both. Replay compared the last item to the first and rejected continuation. The forced-delta trial also omitted a pending tool result because this changed the cut point. Both baselines were streamed-only, so terminal output was not the cause. The earlier Matplotlib mismatch remains unconfirmed at item level.

Commit `da61a6cfc` keeps both signatures through replay. In natural Seaborn trial `LCaz49G`, dual-reasoning responses 5 and 6 were followed by nonempty tool-output deltas on requests 6 and 7, with no fallback or missing-output error. Nine of ten requests sent deltas; requests 1 and 2 reported zero cache reads. Eight owned processes stopped with none surviving. See ignored `hatfield-harbor/reports/swe-bench-seaborn-multi-reasoning-preserve-2026-09-23.json`.

Commit `540ebf90a` stops masking unexpected mismatches: the client logs a bounded reason, closes the cached connection, and fails without sending or retrying. Compaction summarization and the first turn after history replacement explicitly start a new baseline without `previous_response_id`; later turns can send deltas. This change has deterministic proof but no new live trial. The zero-cache cause remains unknown.
