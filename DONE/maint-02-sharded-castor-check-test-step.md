# MAINT-02 Make castor check use sharded test runner

## Goal
Post-MAINT-01 issue: standalone `castor test` runs in ~45-51s because it uses the sharded parallel runner, but `LLM_MODE=true castor check` reports the `test` step at ~103s. Scout found `.castor/tasks.php::check()` builds the `test` step as a direct monolithic `vendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group tui-e2e --exclude-group llm-real` command, bypassing `castor test` / `run_test_suites_parallel()`. Fix check so the normal `test` step uses the same sharded runner and per-worker DB/cache/report isolation as standalone `castor test`, while preserving top-level parallel check behavior and `test:controller`, `test:llm-real`, `test:tui` handling. Avoid pcntl_fork; use proc_open/external subprocesses only.

## Acceptance criteria
- `LLM_MODE=true castor check` test step uses the same sharded execution path as `castor test` instead of a single monolithic phpunit process.
- `castor test` remains ~45-55s and `castor test --filter=...` remains sequential.
- `LLM_MODE=true castor check` report/log output clearly shows or records the nested test shards so it is obvious they run in parallel.
- Per-worker `HATFIELD_TEST_DATABASE_PATH`, `HATFIELD_CACHE_DIR`, PHPUnit cache, JUnit/log isolation are preserved for the check test step.
- No `pcntl_fork` is introduced.
- Validation passes: `castor test`, `castor test:tui`, `castor test:llm-real`, `castor phpstan`, `castor deptrac`, `castor cs-check`, and preferably full `LLM_MODE=true castor check`.

- Validation: castor test:llm-real: PASS (5 tests, 51 assertions); LLM_MODE=true timeout --kill-after=15s 140s castor check: PASS; wall time ~52s; all 13 steps OK (deptrac, 7 unit shards, test:controller, test:llm-real, test:tui, phpstan, cs-check)
- Summary: Implemented direct castor check sharding: check now launches unit shards as first-class parallel steps instead of the monolithic PHPUnit step, with per-step timeout wrapping and collision-free report names. Hardened llm-real smoke tests with target-tool event collection and precise prompts/assertions, and reduced TUI E2E waits to fail fast on exact UI proofs. Temp-0 llama.cpp validation passed; branch pushed at commit 96448f3b.

- Validation: castor cs-check: PASS (files_fixed=0)
- Summary: Updated testing guidance after MAINT-02: .agents/skills/testing/SKILL.md and tests/AGENTS.md now document 13-step sharded castor check, per-worker DB/cache/report isolation, deterministic llama.cpp temp=0 expectation, target-tool controller event collection, precise LLM smoke prompts, short TUI E2E waits, and stale worker cleanup guidance. Pushed commit 1ff847d5 to PR branch.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-11T17:01:49.071Z
- Validation: PR #115 was already merged on GitHub; main fast-forwarded before DONE transition.; move_task to DONE: PASS; task branch already up to date, worktree removed, metadata pushed.; Post-merge `LLM_MODE=true castor check`: FAILED only on `test:tui` (exit code 2). Passing steps: deptrac, all 7 unit shards, test:controller, test:llm-real, phpstan, cs-check. Failure: `ShellPrefixSmokeTest::testFirstInputShellLsShowsOutputAndAllowsNextPrompt` timed out after 2s waiting for `✕`; log `var/reports/check-test:tui.log`.; Follow-up task created: `maint-04-shell-prefix-tui-wait-failure`.
- Summary: Post-merge validation on main found one TUI E2E failure after MAINT-02 was merged: `ShellPrefixSmokeTest::testFirstInputShellLsShowsOutputAndAllowsNextPrompt` timed out after 2s waiting for `✕` while the pane showed shell output succeeded and the following normal prompt was still `◐ Working...` after about 9s. Created follow-up task `maint-04-shell-prefix-tui-wait-failure` for investigation/fix. Worktree cleanup completed by move_task.
