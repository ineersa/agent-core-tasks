# 10-refactor-tui-screen-picker: split screen sections and picker overlay

## Goal
Plan: .pi/plans/architecture-refactor-plan.md
Reports: .pi/reports/tui-architecture.md, .pi/reports/tests-architecture.md

Improve TUI composition testability by splitting ChatScreen into composable sections and extracting shared picker overlay lifecycle code.

Scope:
- Extract PickerOverlay from ModelPickerController and FavoritePickerController lifecycle boilerplate.
- Split ChatScreen into per-section objects or a screen model that owns LiveTextWidget production and slot rendering per section.
- Preserve TuiSlotRegistry extension slots, ChatScreen listener-facing public API, mount order, and terminal-resize responsiveness.
- Remove unused empty widget stubs if still unused and safe.

## Acceptance criteria
- Picker controllers share common overlay lifecycle code and keep only selection-specific behavior.
- ChatScreen is reduced to orchestration with section-level units that can be tested without full tmux E2E.
- Startup snapshot and TUI smoke expectations remain stable or are intentionally updated with documented visual changes.
- Run and report Castor validation: focused TUI tests, castor test:tui, and castor check where prerequisites allow, or exact environmental blockers.

## Finalized implementation plan

### Scope decisions
- Include QuestionController in PickerOverlay extraction (all 3 overlay controllers)
- Skip ChatScreen section splitting — renderables already testable, closures trivial, extraction not justified (consistent with task 05 cancellation rationale)
- Remove 3 dead widget stubs
- Leave FavoritePickerController tests in shared ModelPickerControllerTest.php

### Part A — PickerOverlay extraction

**New file: `src/Tui/Picker/PickerOverlay.php`** (~80 lines)
Final class owning shared overlay lifecycle:
- Properties: `listWidget` (SelectListWidget), `container` (ContainerWidget), `isOpen` (bool), `tui` (?Tui), `screen` (?ChatScreen)
- `mount(Tui, ChatScreen, SelectListWidget, TextWidget $header): void` — compose container, add to tui, focus list, set isOpen=true
- `close(): void` — remove container from tui, null refs, set isOpen=false
- `isOpen(): bool`
- Keybindings are provided by the caller (standard 6-entry array: up/down/page_up/page_down/enter/esc)

**Modify: `src/Tui/Picker/ModelPickerController.php`** (362→~280 lines)
- Constructor stays: ModelSelectionService, AppConfig, LoggerInterface
- `setRuntimeRefs()` stores Tui, ChatScreen, TuiSessionState
- `open()` delegates to PickerOverlay: builds items via `buildItemsStatic()`, creates header, creates SelectListWidget with 6 keybindings, calls overlay.mount()
- onSelect static closure: calls `applySelectEffect()` then `overlay.close()`
- onCancel static closure: calls `overlay.close()`
- onInput for Ctrl+F: keeps in-place favorite toggle + item rebuild
- `applySelectEffect()` unchanged (persists model change, updates footer)
- `applyCloseEffect()` deleted — replaced by overlay.close()

**Modify: `src/Tui/Picker/FavoritePickerController.php`** (250→~170 lines)
- Constructor stays: ModelSelectionService, LoggerInterface
- `setRuntimeRefs()` stays
- `open()` delegates to PickerOverlay: builds items via `buildFavoritesItems()`, creates header, SelectListWidget, overlay.mount()
- onSelect: calls overlay.close() (no side effects — Enter just closes)
- onCancel: calls overlay.close()
- onInput for Space: keeps favorite toggle + item rebuild
- `applyCloseEffect()` deleted

**Modify: `src/Tui/Question/QuestionController.php`** (226→~170 lines)
- Constructor stays: QuestionCoordinator
- Currently uses TuiRuntimeContext (1 arg) instead of 3 separate refs — adapt: extract tui/screen from context internally
- `open()` delegates to PickerOverlay for SelectList-based question kinds (Choice/Approval)
- Text/Confirm kinds that don't use SelectListWidget stay as-is (no overlay)
- close() calls overlay.close() + additional cleanup (setStatus(null), refresh())

**New file: `tests/Tui/Picker/PickerOverlayTest.php`** (~100 lines)
- Test mount sets isOpen=true
- Test close sets isOpen=false and nulls refs
- Test close is idempotent
- Test isOpen guard prevents double-mount

### Part B — Remove dead widget stubs

**Delete:**
- `src/Tui/Widget/PromptInputWidget.php` (14 lines, empty class with @todo)
- `src/Tui/Widget/ToolOutputWidget.php` (14 lines, empty class with @todo)
- `src/Tui/Transcript/TranscriptWidget.php` (54 lines, legacy @todo replaced by TranscriptBlockWidget)

**Verify:** grep for any imports/usages before deletion.

### Validation
- `castor test --filter=PickerOverlay`
- `castor test --filter=ModelPicker`
- `castor test --filter=Question`
- `castor test`
- `castor deptrac`
- `castor phpstan`
- `castor cs-check`
- TUI E2E smoke (`castor test:tui`) if prerequisites available
