# PT-03 TUI prompt-template slash commands and runtime dispatch

## Goal
Reference plan: `.pi/plans/prompt-templates-implementation-plan.md`.

Scope:
- Depends on PT-01.
- Register prompt templates as TUI slash commands using the catalog contract from PT-01.
- Keep real slash commands authoritative: template commands fill gaps only and run after real registrars.
- Implement `DispatchRuntime` handling in `SubmitListener` so `/template args` follows the normal start/steer/follow-up runtime path.
- Do not modify `CommandMetadata` or `SlashCommandCompletionProvider` for `argument-hint`; unknown frontmatter hint fields are non-MVP.

Can run in parallel with PT-02 after PT-01 lands.

## Acceptance criteria
- `PromptTemplateCommandRegistrar` registers one virtual slash command per catalog template, lower-priority than real registrars, with real commands winning on name collisions.
- Registered template slash commands return `DispatchRuntime` with the original slash text and generic usage such as `/<name> <args>`.
- `SubmitListener` handles `DispatchRuntime` by forwarding the payload through the same runtime path as normal prompts for initial start, active steer, and idle follow-up.
- TUI command names align with lowercase canonical names from PT-01 and existing `CommandParser` lowercasing; no parser case-behavior change.
- Tests cover registrar metadata, real-command collision skip, handler returns `DispatchRuntime`, SubmitListener start/steer/follow-up forwarding, and runtime error handling.
- Because this touches TUI/runtime flow, `LLM_MODE=true castor check` must pass before moving this task to CODE-REVIEW; if prerequisites are unavailable, keep the task IN-PROGRESS and record the blocker.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-12T18:08:24.597Z
- Moved TODO → IN-PROGRESS.
- Created branch task/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch.
- Created worktree /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch.
- Copied vendor directory into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch.
- Copied .vera index into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch.
- Summary: Claiming PT-03 for TUI prompt-template slash command registration and SubmitListener DispatchRuntime forwarding. Depends on PT-01/PT-02 now merged. Implementation must include real TmuxHarness + test LLM E2E proof for the user-visible `/template args` TUI path before handoff.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-12T18:16:07.889Z
- Validation: context: read task file and `.pi/plans/prompt-templates-implementation-plan.md` PT-03 sections; scout: TUI slash command architecture explored (`SlashCommandRegistry`, `CommandParser`, `DispatchRuntime`, `TuiListenerRegistrar`, `services.yaml` tagging); scout: SubmitListener dispatch flow explored; normal prompt dispatch has start/draft-promotion, post-shell restart, steer, follow_up, shared error handling; `DispatchRuntime` currently ignored by `applyCommandResult()`; scout: TUI E2E harness explored; mandatory test should create isolated `.hatfield/prompts/review.md`, launch real TUI with test LLM, type `/review <marker>`, and assert expanded prompt appears in transcript via TmuxHarness
- Summary: Claimed PT-03 and gathered implementation context. Worktree: `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch` on branch `task/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch`. Note: integration checkout had unrelated untracked `.pi/plans/mcp-client-implementation-plan.md`; temporarily stashed/restored only to satisfy clean-checkout task claim. It remains untracked on main and is unrelated to PT-03.

- Summary: Implementation fork completed and committed `c7adbed7` (`PT-03: TUI prompt-template slash command registration and DispatchRuntime forwarding`). Worktree clean on branch `task/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch`. Diff stat against `origin/main...HEAD`: 6 files changed, 1002 insertions, 118 deletions. Implemented `PromptTemplateCommandRegistrar` with priority -100, priority-aware TUI listener iterator wiring, `SubmitListener` DispatchRuntime forwarding through shared runtime dispatch helper, unit tests for registrar and SubmitListener behavior, and mandatory TmuxHarness E2E proof for `/review <marker>` prompt template submission. Scope exclusions respected: no docs/PT-04 work, no built-ins, no CommandMetadata argument-hint changes, no runtime/client PT-02 changes.

- Validation: reviewer initial verdict: APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS — actionable findings addressed by forks; reviewer follow-up verdict: REQUEST CHANGES — immediate working indicator regression from stale base fixed by rebase/fix fork; reviewer final verdict: APPROVED; castor test — OK: agent-core 292/1263, coding-agent-1 286/816, coding-agent-2 382/990, coding-agent-3 413/1112, coding-agent-4 375/1114, tui 686/1746, platform 54/221; total 2488 tests, 0 failures; LLM_MODE=true castor test:tui — OK (20 tests, 59 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped); castor deptrac — OK (0 violations, 0 errors); castor phpstan — OK (0 errors); castor cs-check — OK (0 fixes)
- Summary: PT-03 task-to-pr review completed. Initial reviewer returned APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS; fix fork `mzrr2yggobkk` committed `d00d0ab8` addressing draft-promotion/shell-restart DispatchRuntime test coverage, DispatchRuntime docblock, registrar test comments, and llm-real E2E group. Follow-up fork `wnmevhdws146` committed `f6a18a65` addressing remaining low-risk NTHs (handler reuse, clearer error-activity test naming, TestDirectoryIsolation for draft-promotion sessions). Final reviewer then found a stale-base regression against origin/main immediate working feedback; rebase/fix fork `sjfyn0g44gz2` rebased branch onto current origin/main and produced final HEAD `41202988`, preserving origin/main immediate `Working...` forced-render behavior inside shared `dispatchToRuntime()`. Final reviewer verdict: APPROVED. Worktree clean; merge-base equals origin/main (`6986d44f`). Diff stat: 7 files changed, 1103 insertions, 127 deletions.

- Recorded fork run: t0wmivj7d2pf
- Validation: first move_task quality gate: all steps OK except `test:tui` exit 124; phpunit log showed OK (20 tests, 59 assertions) in 91.948s, just over the 90s check step timeout; LLM_MODE=true castor test:tui --filter=PromptTemplateSlashCommandE2ETest — OK (1 test, 1 assertion) after wait removal; castor cs-check — OK (0 fixes); fork reported full LLM_MODE=true castor test:tui had unrelated/pre-existing LLM response timeouts in other E2E tests during its run; PT-03 test passed
- Summary: After first CODE-REVIEW move attempt, Castor quality gate failed only because `test:tui` hit the 90s step timeout although PHPUnit reported OK at 91.948s. Fix fork `t0wmivj7d2pf` committed `9d5f3c5d`, removing the non-essential optional 15s post-assertion assistant/error wait from `PromptTemplateSlashCommandE2ETest` while preserving the real TmuxHarness + test LLM core proof that expanded `Review: <marker>` appears in tmux history. Worktree remains clean at HEAD `9d5f3c5d`. Diff stat now 7 files changed, 1089 insertions, 127 deletions.

- Validation: castor cs-check — OK (0 fixes); manual file inspection: `.hatfield/prompts/report.md` frontmatter contains only supported `description`; body starts with `User reported issue:` fenced `text` block containing `$ARGUMENTS`; git push origin task/prompt-templates-03-tui-slash-command-dispatch — OK; origin updated ed200677..8f012b46
- Summary: Added daily-use project prompt template `.hatfield/prompts/report.md` on the PT-03 PR branch and pushed it to PR #138. The final amended commit is `8f012b46` (`Add report prompt template for /report issue filing with diagnostics`). The template uses `$ARGUMENTS` in the body as the actual prompt-template argument substitution mechanism, rendering `/report <issue>` as a fenced `User reported issue` block before model instructions. The misleading ignored `arguments:` frontmatter was removed. Branch is now synced with origin.

- Summary: Reopening PT-03 for a small prompt-template refinement requested by user: remove gist/upload attachment guidance from `.hatfield/prompts/report.md` and instruct the model to provide absolute local paths to sanitized snapshot/log artifacts instead. PR #138 remains open; no reviewer step required for this prompt-only tweak unless requested.

- Summary: Refined `.hatfield/prompts/report.md` per user feedback: removed gist/upload workaround guidance and now instructs the model to include absolute paths to sanitized local diagnostic artifacts directly in the issue body/final response. Fork amended report-template commit to `9621e8ae`; branch was force-pushed with lease to update PR #138 from prior `8f012b46` to `9621e8ae`. Worktree clean.
