# Fix issue #153 tool execution visibility bypass

## Goal
GitHub issue: https://github.com/ineersa/agent-core/issues/153

Problem: tool visibility/exclusion is enforced for model-facing schemas/listings but not for actual execution. `RegistryBackedToolbox::execute()` resolves through `ToolRegistry::toolDefinition()`, and scouts confirmed `toolDefinition()` currently returns registered permanent/dynamic definitions without applying `isToolVisible()`. `activeToolDefinitions()`/`activeToolNames()` are filtered, so excluded tools are hidden from discovery but can still execute through direct toolbox calls or execution paths without a `tools_ref` allowlist guard.

Scout recommendation: make the single-tool lookup used by execution visibility-aware (preferred: add an `isToolVisible()` guard in `ToolRegistry::toolDefinition()` and update interface/docblocks). `RegistryBackedToolbox::execute()` already handles `null` by throwing Symfony AI `ToolNotFoundException`, which is a clear unavailable-tool outcome and prevents handler/tool output from leaking.

Test target: `tests/CodingAgent/Tool/RegistryBackedToolboxTest.php` for the execution regression, optionally `tests/CodingAgent/Tool/ToolRegistryTest.php` for direct lookup semantics. Testing docs were loaded before creating this task.

## Acceptance criteria
- Excluded tools cannot execute through `RegistryBackedToolbox::execute()`; the handler must not be invoked.
- Allowlist-filtered tools are also treated as unavailable for execution.
- Existing schema/listing behavior remains unchanged (`getTools()`/active definitions still filter as before).
- Add regression coverage proving an excluded registered tool is rejected on execution with `ToolNotFoundException` or equivalent unavailable-tool behavior and no sensitive tool output leak.
- Run focused validation through Castor, at minimum `castor test --suite=coding-agent --filter=RegistryBackedToolboxTest` plus any targeted registry tests touched.

- Recorded fork run: 206ynkox7fl5
- Summary: Implementation fork launched in worktree `/home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/issue-153-tool-execution-visibility` to make tool execution visibility-aware and add regression coverage for issue #153. Fork instructed to read testing skill + tests/AGENTS.md, use Castor validation, commit changes, and hand off results.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-17T16:15:34.764Z
- Recorded fork run: 206ynkox7fl5
- Summary: Fork 206ynkox7fl5 completed implementation at commit 9351ceb11. Verification confirmed expected changed files and diff stat (4 files: ToolRegistry, ToolRegistryInterface, RegistryBackedToolboxTest, ToolRegistryTest). Root fix matches scout recommendation: `ToolRegistry::toolDefinition()` now returns null when `isToolVisible()` is false, causing `RegistryBackedToolbox::execute()` to reject excluded/allowlist-filtered tools with ToolNotFoundException. During orchestrator verification, two new `RegistryBackedToolboxTest` methods had handler-call assertions placed after `expectException()` execution, making those assertions unreachable. Launching a follow-up fork to tighten the regression tests so handler non-invocation is actually asserted.

- Recorded fork run: 1fwj6ofj0h9g
- Summary: Follow-up fork launched to tighten `RegistryBackedToolboxTest` regression assertions. Required change: replace unreachable handler-call assertions after expected exceptions with reachable try/catch assertions proving excluded/allowlist-filtered tool handlers are not invoked.

- Summary: Follow-up fork 1fwj6ofj0h9g completed at commit b34273611. Verified worktree is clean and final diff contains expected files only: ToolRegistry production fix/docblock, ToolRegistryInterface docblock, RegistryBackedToolboxTest regressions, ToolRegistryTest semantics tests. Follow-up changed only `tests/CodingAgent/Tool/RegistryBackedToolboxTest.php` to make handler non-invocation assertions reachable via try/catch after expected `ToolNotFoundException`. Final branch head: b34273611 (`fix: make handler non-invocation assertions reachable in visibility tests`).

- Summary: Task-to-PR review completed for HEAD b34273611dd. Reviewer subagent verdict: APPROVED. Reviewer confirmed testing skill and tests/AGENTS.md were read, tests follow conventions, production fix closes issue #153, and handler non-invocation is genuinely asserted. Non-blocking notes were reviewed and skipped as cosmetic/redundant/out-of-scope: the internal test call id naming suggestion is cosmetic, combined allowlist+denylist execute-seam coverage is redundant with existing `isToolVisible()` coverage, and shared local test helpers are pre-existing. No implementation follow-up required.
