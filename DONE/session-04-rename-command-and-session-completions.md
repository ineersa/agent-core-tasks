# SESSION-04 /rename command and session argument completions

## Goal
Add session rename UX and completion support for session-taking slash commands.

## Desired UX
- `/rename` opens a recent-session picker near the bottom/editor area.
- Selecting a session inserts a generated command into the editor, e.g. `/rename <session id> `, so the user can type the new name.
- `/rename <session id> <new name>` executes the rename.
- If no name is provided, show an error with a concrete command hint using the selected/provided real session id.
- For all completion flows, Tab inserts a completion into the editor while Enter executes the command/picker selection.

## Current code facts

### Key difference from `/resume` picker
`/resume` picker executes on selection. `/rename` picker must **insert** a partial command into the editor and return focus. This requires:
1. Picker `onSelect()` → construct string like `/rename <sessionId> ` → insert into editor → close picker
2. Editor access via `ChatScreen::getEditor()` → `editor->insertText(string)` or equivalent

### Editor API (from `src/Tui/Editor/PromptEditor.php` + `PromptEditorWidget.php`)
- `extract(): EditorState` — returns current text snapshot
- `clear(): void` — resets editor content
- Editor can be accessed via `ChatScreen::getEditor()` which is returned by `InteractiveMode::run()` but not currently exposed via `TuiRuntimeContext`
- **May need** to expose editor or add an `insertText()` method to `ChatScreen` or `TuiRuntimeContext` for use by command handlers.

### Tab completion (EDITOR-08, NOT YET implemented)
- Task `tasks/TODO/editor-08-completion-foundation-slash.md`:
  - `CompletionProvider` interface, `CompletionSuggestion`, `CompletionState`
  - Completion menu rendering near editor
  - `SlashCommandCompletionProvider` backed by registry metadata
  - Tab: accept selected or trigger slash completion
  - Escape: close completion without clearing text
- Bot commands like `/resume <sessionId>` and `/rename <sessionId>` will need a `SessionIdCompletionProvider` that calls `HatfieldSessionStore::listSessions()` for suggestions.

### Session metadata update path
- `HatfieldSessionStore::updateMetadata(string $sessionId, array $meta): void` — merges known keys
- After SESSION-01 adds `name` support, rename is simply:
  ```php
  $this->sessionStore->updateMetadata($sessionId, ['name' => $newName]);
  ```

## Implementation seams

### New file: `src/Tui/Command/RenameSessionCommand.php`
```php
class RenameSessionCommand implements SlashCommandHandler {
    public function __construct(
        private HatfieldSessionStore $sessionStore,
        private ChatScreen $screen,
    ) {}

    public function handle(SlashCommand $cmd): CommandResult {
        // Parse args: sessionId + newName
        $args = preg_split('/\s+/', trim($cmd->args), 2);
        $sessionId = $args[0] ?? '';
        $newName = $args[1] ?? '';

        if ('' === $sessionId) {
            // Open picker → onSelect inserts /rename <id>  into editor
            $this->openRenamePicker();
            return new NoOp();
        }

        if ('' === $newName) {
            return new TranscriptMessage(
                'Provide a name. Example: `/rename '.$sessionId.' My session`'
            );
        }

        if (!$this->sessionStore->exists($sessionId)) {
            return new TranscriptMessage('Session not found: '.$sessionId);
        }

        $this->sessionStore->updateMetadata($sessionId, ['name' => $newName]);
        return new TranscriptMessage('Session '.$sessionId.' renamed to "'.$newName.'"');
    }
}
```

### Picker insertion (picker `onSelect`)
```php
$listWidget->onSelect(function (SelectEvent $e) use ($editor, $overlay): void {
    $sessionId = $e->item->value;
    $editor->clear();
    $editor->insertText('/rename '.$sessionId.' ');
    $overlay->close();
    // Focus returns to editor naturally
});
```

### Completion provider (after EDITOR-08)
```php
class SessionIdCompletionProvider implements CompletionProvider {
    public function __construct(private HatfieldSessionStore $sessionStore) {}
    public function getSuggestions(string $prefix): array {
        return array_map(
            fn(array $s) => new CompletionSuggestion(
                value: $s['sessionId'],
                display: $s['displayTitle'],
                insert: $s['sessionId'].' ',
            ),
            $this->sessionStore->listSessions(limit: 30)
        );
    }
}
```

## Known pitfalls
- Picker insertion requires editor access from the command handler. If `TuiRuntimeContext` doesn't expose the editor, either:
  - Add `ChatScreen::insertText(string): void`
  - Or expose `PromptEditor` through `TuiRuntimeContext`
- Command parsing: `/rename` args must split on first space to separate sessionId (which never contains spaces, it's numeric) from the rest (which may contain spaces). Use `explode(' ', ..., 2)` or `preg_split('/\s+/', ..., 2)`.
- `/rename <sessionId> <new name>` where sessionId is quoted/special: not needed since IDs are numeric strings.
- Completion for session IDs depends on EDITOR-08. If that task is delayed, `/rename` direct command and picker-insertion can still ship without tab completion.
- Display fallback for unnamed sessions must not be persisted (keep `name` null in DB).
- No backward-compatibility shims for old sessions without name field.

## Dependencies
- SESSION-01 for name metadata/listing.
- SESSION-03 for session picker command patterns.
- EDITOR-08 completion foundation and slash command completion before implementing Tab insertion/completion semantics.

## Out of scope
- Switching sessions (`/resume`, `/new`).
- Tree navigation.
- Renaming old compatibility session IDs not present in the DB.

## Acceptance criteria
- `/rename` is registered with help/usage metadata and supports `/rename <session id> <new name>` direct execution.
- `/rename` with no args opens a session picker that displays session id and current name/display fallback.
- Selecting from the picker inserts a concrete editable command into the prompt editor rather than executing immediately, leaving the cursor ready for the new name.
- Executing with no new name reports a clear error and includes an actionable example using the real session id, e.g. `/rename 42 My session name`.
- Successful rename updates session metadata and refreshes any visible picker/footer/session display that references that session.
- Session-id completions are available for `/resume` and `/rename` after EDITOR-08; Tab inserts selected completions into the editor and Enter executes.
- Tests cover direct rename, missing-name error hint, picker insertion, completion insertion, and metadata persistence.
- Docs/help text document `/rename`, `/resume <id>`, and completion behavior.
- Validation uses Castor per project rules; runtime/TUI changes require full `castor check` before CODE-REVIEW.

- Validation: Post-merge validation: `LLM_MODE=true castor check` was started on main after DONE merge but hung after an unrelated TUI E2E failure in `Ineersa\Tui\Tests\E2E\ShellPrefixSmokeTest::testFirstInputShellLsShowsOutputAndAllowsNextPrompt` (timed out waiting 2s for `✕` while pane showed `Say exactly: hello` still Working). Most check shards passed; `test:tui` failed/hung cleanup left castor:check and PHAR messenger consumers running, which were killed manually.; Post-merge SESSION-04-specific E2E: `castor test:tui --filter=SessionRenameE2ETest` — PASS (3 tests, 3 assertions). User will fix unrelated ShellPrefixSmokeTest/Castor hang in another task.
- Summary: Task remains DONE. PR #116 was merged and task worktree removed. The only post-merge validation issue observed was unrelated to SESSION-04; SESSION-04 TmuxHarness E2E proof passes on main.
