# RTVS-08A Remove transcript.jsonl and replay transcripts from events.jsonl

## Goal
## Context
User decision: remove `.hatfield/sessions/<id>/transcript.jsonl` instead of keeping a second transcript projection/cache. `events.jsonl` should be the canonical replay source for resume/relaunch, with `state.json` reserved for AgentCore continuation state.

Scout findings:
- `runtime-events.jsonl` was deleted by the async/headless plan; do not revive it.
- Current `transcript.jsonl` is lossy and inconsistent: TUI writes user/system/slash-command entries, controller mode writes finalized projected blocks collapsed to role/text/meta, and TUI runtime projection is in memory only.
- Current resume path (`SessionInitializer::buildInitialTranscript()`) reads `transcript.jsonl`; this must change to replay canonical events through `RuntimeEventMapper` + `TranscriptProjector`.
- Critical gap before removal: current `events.jsonl`/`RuntimeEventTranslator` does not appear to emit `user.message_submitted` for normal user prompts/follow-ups/steers, so replay may miss user message blocks unless AgentCore emits replayable user-message events or the mapper can derive them from canonical events.

Primary production touchpoints identified by scouts:
- `src/Tui/Application/SessionInitializer.php` — replace `transcript.jsonl` resume loading with event replay; set `TuiSessionState::lastSeq` to max replayed seq.
- `src/Tui/Listener/SubmitListener.php` — stop writing user/slash-command transcript entries; keep in-memory block updates.
- `src/CodingAgent/Session/HatfieldSessionStore.php` — stop creating/reading/writing `transcript.jsonl`; remove transcript store APIs.
- `src/CodingAgent/Session/TranscriptEntry.php` — remove persisted DTO if no longer used.
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Session/TranscriptPersistenceService.php` and `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Controller/RuntimeEventEmitter.php` — remove headless/controller transcript persistence wiring.
- `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Protocol/RuntimeEventTranslator.php` and AgentCore event emission — ensure user messages are present in canonical event replay.

No compatibility fallback to old `transcript.jsonl` should be added unless explicitly requested; active development rules prefer replacing old behavior.

## Acceptance criteria
- New sessions no longer create `.hatfield/sessions/<id>/transcript.jsonl`.
- No production code reads or writes `transcript.jsonl`; `HatfieldSessionStore::appendTranscriptEntry()` and `getTranscript()` are removed.
- Persisted `Ineersa\CodingAgent\Session\TranscriptEntry` DTO is removed if unused after transcript file removal.
- Resume/relaunch rebuilds TUI `TranscriptBlock` history by reading canonical `events.jsonl`, mapping `RunEvent` to `RuntimeEvent`, and feeding a reset `TranscriptProjector`.
- Replay sets the TUI dedup cursor (`lastSeq`) to the max replayed persistent runtime event seq so the live poller does not duplicate history after resume.
- `events.jsonl` contains or can derive all transcript-critical user inputs: initial prompt, follow-up messages, steers, and accepted HITL answers where applicable.
- Replayed transcript covers at least user + assistant messages and one tool, HITL, cancellation, or error sequence.
- Controller/headless runtime no longer persists projected blocks to `transcript.jsonl`; runtime events remain emitted to the TUI transport and canonical events remain in `events.jsonl`.
- Tests updated to remove `transcript.jsonl` file assertions/diagnostic dumps and add resume-from-events coverage.
- Docs and task/plan references updated to remove `transcript.jsonl` and stale `runtime-events.jsonl` as session projection files.
- `castor deptrac` passes; full validation must use Castor per project rules.

- Copied .vera index into /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/rtvs-08a-remove-transcript-jsonl.
- Summary: Started RTVS-08A task-start phase. Main agent remains orchestrator; implementation will be delegated to a fork in the task worktree.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-07T21:32:04.340Z
- Validation: No validation run in main agent during task-start; implementation delegated to fork per workflow.
- Summary: Task-start scout recon completed in worktree /home/ineersa/projects/agent-core-worktrees/rtvs-08a-remove-transcript-jsonl. Scouts confirmed transcript.jsonl removal touches HatfieldSessionStore, SessionInitializer, SubmitListener, RuntimeEventEmitter, TranscriptPersistenceService, services.yaml, tests/diagnostics, docs/AGENTS/skills. Critical implementation gap: events.jsonl currently cannot replay user messages because RuntimeEventTranslator emits no user.message_submitted and AgentCore command-applied events omit steer/follow_up message text. Fork instructions will include adding replayable user-message runtime mappings and canonical payload data before removing transcript.jsonl I/O.

- Summary: Implementation fork completed RTVS-08A and committed 57a4fffc on branch task/rtvs-08a-remove-transcript-jsonl. Removed production transcript.jsonl I/O and deleted persisted TranscriptEntry + TranscriptPersistenceService; resume now rebuilds TUI transcript blocks from events.jsonl via SessionRunEventStore → RuntimeEventMapper → TranscriptProjector; user replay gaps closed for initial prompt and steer/follow_up; SubmitListener normal prompts now use canonical runtime projection rather than local persisted echo.

Merge had 0 git conflicts but full tests found semantic constructor mismatch from main's TOOLS-09B tests still passing removed RuntimeEventEmitter transcriptPersistence named parameter; fork fixed 2 test files and committed.

- Recorded fork run: 04a0a881
- Validation: fork-reported raw validation (not accepted as final project validation): tests/static checks passed; parent will rerun Castor commands per AGENTS.md
- Summary: Reviewer-fix fork addressed APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS findings and committed 04a0a881. Fixes include robust SessionInitializer lastSeq fallback for all-null event mapping; cleanup of stale transcript.jsonl docs; deletion of empty HatfieldSessionStoreTest vestiges; RuntimeEventTranslator helper simplification; UserMessageProjectionSubscriber seq comment; added mapper/projector tests for run.started user_messages and follow_up user.message_submitted mapping. Note: fork reported using raw vendor/bin commands due Castor runtime confusion, so parent will rerun required Castor validation before CODE-REVIEW.

- Summary: Final reviewer-cleanup fork committed 8966325f. Addressed stale HatfieldSessionStore lock docblock and removed transcript.jsonl from LlamaCppSmokeTest diagnostics. Fork verified remaining transcript.jsonl PHP references are intentional: absence assertion and design comment. Worktree clean.

- Summary: Task-to-PR review complete. Reviewer subagent approved current HEAD 8966325f after two iteration forks. All prior actionable findings resolved; final reviewer verdict: APPROVED. Current branch diff is RTVS-08A implementation plus main merge and reviewer fixes.
- task-to-pr: inspected worktree status/log/diff; launched reviewer subagent; addressed APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS findings via forks 04a0a881, 20d767af, and 8966325f; final reviewer approved HEAD 8966325f; focused local Castor validation passed. Moving to CODE-REVIEW will run the full Castor quality gate and create/update PR.

- Validation: move_task CODE-REVIEW full Castor gate: FAILED; Failure: castor check -> test:tui failed; tests/Tui/E2E/TuiStartupSnapshotTest::testStartupLayoutMatchesGoldenSnapshot snapshot mismatch; Diff excerpt: actual contains `❯ hello from tmux e2e` before `◐ Working...`; expected had only `◐ Working...` at that location
- Summary: move_task(to=CODE-REVIEW) attempted full Castor quality gate but failed; task remains IN-PROGRESS. Gate failure is in TUI snapshot test: TuiStartupSnapshotTest expected startup snapshot without submitted editor text, but actual normalized snapshot includes `❯ hello from tmux e2e` above Working. Need fork to analyze whether this is intentional UI shift from canonical-only user echo/removing local transcript block and update code/snapshot via Castor-only workflow.

- Summary: Castor-gate fix fork completed and committed 9248af7c. Root cause of previous CODE-REVIEW gate failure was stale TUI startup golden snapshot: RTVS-08A correctly projects the initial --prompt user message from canonical run_started/user_messages, rendering `❯ hello from tmux e2e`. Fork updated tests/Tui/Snapshots/startup-120x40.txt by one line. Worktree clean at 9248af7c.

- Summary: Post-snapshot final reviewer check approved current HEAD 9248af7c. Reviewer confirmed the only change since previous approval is the startup snapshot adding `❯ hello from tmux e2e`, which correctly reflects canonical user message projection from --prompt/run_started.
