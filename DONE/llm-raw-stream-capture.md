# Capture raw real LLM stream chunks for DurableResultConverter debugging

## Goal
Context: normal `.hatfield/sessions/*/events.jsonl` persists only canonical coarse events (`llm_step_completed`, final `assistant_message.tool_calls`, `tool_execution_start/end`, etc.). Transient streaming deltas are `seq=0` runtime/TUI events and raw provider SSE chunks are not saved. Existing `StreamRecorderObserver` / `castor llm:fixtures:record` captures converted Symfony AI deltas, not raw provider chunks. To debug/upstream DurableResultConverter behavior around multiple/parallel tool calls and phantom/empty-id chunks, we need an opt-in way to capture the complete raw provider stream for a single turn.

Goal: add a safe, opt-in capture path around `src/Platform/Bridge/Generic/DurableResultConverter.php::convertStream()` that records every raw decoded provider `$data` chunk, plus enough metadata to correlate with converted deltas/canonical events, for real live LLM turns exhibiting multiple tool calls.

Important constraints:
- Must be disabled by default and never run in normal QA/castor check.
- Must not leak private data unexpectedly; require explicit env/config opt-in and write to a clearly named local debug path.
- Must support capturing a complete turn with multiple tool calls from real providers using the Generic/OpenAI-compatible path (z.ai/llama_cpp/llama_cpp_test/deepseek where applicable).
- Keep DurableResultConverter behavior unchanged when capture is disabled.
- Prefer a structured JSONL artifact that can be attached to issues/upstream reports and turned into deterministic tests.

## Acceptance criteria
- Add opt-in raw stream capture for DurableResultConverter, guarded by explicit env var and/or debug config, disabled by default.
- Captured artifact records each raw `$data` chunk in order as JSONL, with timestamp/ordinal and correlation metadata where available (provider/model/run_id/step_id if feasible, or documented limitations if not available at converter layer).
- Capture artifact also includes or can be correlated with converted deltas (`tool_call_start`, `tool_input_delta`, `tool_call_complete`, text/thinking) so raw→converted behavior is inspectable for multiple tool calls.
- Provide a command or documented workflow to run one real live turn with multiple tool calls and capture the stream completely.
- Add tests proving capture is disabled by default, writes valid JSONL when enabled, and does not alter DurableResultConverter output.
- Document where files are written, safety/privacy implications, and how to use the artifact for DurableResultConverter regression tests/upstream reports.
- Do not persist raw chunks into normal session `events.jsonl` unless explicitly opted in; normal sessions remain canonical/coarse by default.

Verified worktree commit and expected diff stat: 6 files changed (`.castor/run.php`, `docs/llm-replay.md`, `docs/settings.md`, `SymfonyAiProviderFactory.php`, `DurableResultConverter.php`, `DurableResultConverterTest.php`) with 531 insertions / 44 deletions. Fork confirmed it read `.agents/skills/testing/SKILL.md` and `tests/AGENTS.md` before test work.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-17T16:44:22.029Z
- Summary: Pre-PR reviewer subagent returned REQUEST CHANGES. Blockers: actual env-gated JSONL writer untested; duplicate capture_end on stream error; duplicate capture_start from factory and converter; file handle not flushed/closed; incomplete stream emits clean capture_end before throwing; usage TokenUsage not captured/should be documented; security concern about permissive file/dir permissions. Will send implementation fork to address blockers before creating PR.

- Pulled integration checkout: Merge made by the 'ort' strategy..
- Validation: PR #157 merged on GitHub; fork QA (capture): castor test 2576 tests OK, deptrac 0, phpstan 0, cs-check clean; castor check passed during CODE-REVIEW transition (28s); live capture: 209 valid JSONL lines, 3 turns, correct stop_reason + no duplicate markers; spawned upstream issues symfony/ai#2193 and symfony/ai#2194 from captured evidence
- Summary: PR #157 merged. Raw stream capture for DurableResultConverter is implemented, reviewed, fixed per reviewer blockers, and validated (2576 tests / 0 deptrac / 0 phpstan / cs-clean). Live-tested via castor run:agent-capture producing a valid 209-line JSONL artifact across 3 real-provider turns (runpod/Qwen3.6-27B) with multi-tool parallel calls. Capture artifact directly fed two upstream Symfony AI bug reports: symfony/ai#2193 (parallel tool calls collapse) and symfony/ai#2194 (finish_reason not surfaced). Independently, main was bumped to symfony/ai-platform dev-main and the custom IncompleteStreamException was dropped in favor of upstream (e0dfae68c, now on origin/main).
