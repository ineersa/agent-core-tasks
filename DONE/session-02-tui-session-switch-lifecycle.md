# SESSION-02 TUI session switch and reset lifecycle foundation

## Goal
Create the TUI/runtime foundation needed to switch the running TUI between sessions without restarting the whole terminal process.

## Context
Current architecture assumes one TUI process owns one session for its lifetime. Scouts found the hard reset points:
- `ChatScreen` captures session id in the footer provider at construction time.
- `TranscriptProjector` is a stateful DI singleton and must be reset between sessions.
- `QuestionCoordinator` is stateful and has no public reset/clear API.
- `TuiSessionState` contains many mutable per-session fields (`handle`, transcript, `lastSeq`, usage, footer state, poll errors, activity, etc.).
- `JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient` is session/run scoped and process transport must not leak old-session queues/events.

This task should introduce a reusable session switch/reset service or equivalent orchestration seam. Later commands (`/resume`, `/new`) should use this instead of duplicating reset logic.

## Dependencies
- Best after RTVS-08 final resume integration, because switching to an existing session relies on canonical `events.jsonl` transcript replay and rebuild/checkpoint behavior.
- May be implemented before command UI if covered by tests through direct service calls.

## Current code facts

### Primary files to change

#### `src/Tui/Application/InteractiveMode.php`
- Entry point: `run(AgentSessionClient $client, ?StartRunRequest $request, string $sessionId): int`
- Contains `startOrResumeRun()` — calls `client->start()` or `client->resume()`
- Builds `ChatScreen`, mounts widgets, creates `TuiRuntimeContext`, registers all listers
- **Key seam**: add a `switchSession(string $targetSessionId, bool $isResume): void` method or extract to a new `SessionSwitchService`

#### `src/Tui/Application/SessionInitializer.php`
- `initialize(?string $sessionId, ?StartRunRequest $request): TuiSessionState` — creates or validates session
- `buildInitialTranscript(TuiSessionState $state): void` — loads persisted transcript (currently stale until RTVS-08A)
- After RTVS-08A/B, this replays from canonical events.jsonl; the switch service should reuse this same replay path

#### `src/Tui/Runtime/TuiSessionState.php`
Fields that must reset on switch:
```php
public string $sessionId;
public bool $resuming;
public ?RunHandle $handle = null;
public ?StartRunRequest $request = null;
public RunActivityStateEnum $activity = RunActivityStateEnum::Idle;
public array $transcript = [];          // list<TranscriptBlock>
public int $lastSeq = 0;
public float $lastPoll = 0.0;
public int $runtimePollErrorCount = 0;
public string $lastRuntimePollError = '';
public string $footerModel = '';
public string $footerReasoning = '';
public int $contextWindow = 0;
public UsageProjection $usage;
public float $sessionStartTime = 0.0;
public string $cwd = '';
public string $branch = '';
```
Consider adding a `TuiSessionState::resetAllButSessionId(string $sessionId): void` or a standalone reset helper.

#### `src/Tui/Screen/ChatScreen.php`
- `$sessionId` captured in `createDefaultFooterProvider()` closure at construction time.
- **Hardest dependency**: the default footer provider is an anonymous class capturing `$sessionId`. Options:
  - A: Store session ID in a mutable reference (e.g., `TuiSessionState` field wrapped in a closure that reads at render time).
  - B: Add `ChatScreen::updateSessionId(string $id): void` that rebuilds/replaces the footer segment provider.
  - C: Switch to `FooterDataProvider` / slot-based footer that reads from `TuiSessionState` at render time.
  - **Recommendation**: Option A or B — make footer segment provider read from a mutable source or make `ChatScreen` accept a dynamic session-ID segment.

#### `src/Tui/Question/QuestionCoordinator.php`
- No public `reset()` or `clear()` method.
- Internally holds: `?QuestionRequest $active`, `?QuestionStatus $activeStatus`, `\SplQueue $queue`, `array $callbacks`, `array $cancelCallbacks`, `array $requestIds`.
- `\SplQueue` has no `clear()` method — need `while(!$q->isEmpty()) $q->dequeue();` or refactor to `SplDoublyLinkedList::setIteratorMode`.
- **Action**: Add a public `reset(): void` method that closes the active question (if any), drains the queue, and clears all callback registrations.

#### `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Process/JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient.php`
- Session-scoped: maintains `$sessionId`, `$activeRunId`, and session-scoped queue DSNs.
- When switching sessions, the queue DSN suffix changes. Options:
  - A: Restart the controller subprocess with new queue DSNs (heavy but clean).
  - B: Update `$activeRunId` and let the process transport handle it (may cause event leakage from old run).
  - **Recommendation**: Cancel old run (`$this->cancel($oldRunId)`), update `$activeRunId` to the new run, reset `$lastEventCursor` if any.

#### `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/Contract/AgentSessionClient.php`
- Interface: `start()`, `resume()`, `send()`, `events()`, `cancel()`
- A switch must: `cancel()` old run (if running), then `start()` or `resume()` the target.

### DI singletons to reset
| Service | Method | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `TranscriptProjectorInterface` | `reset()` | `src/CodingAgent/Runtime/ProjectionPipeline/TranscriptProjector.php` |
| `QuestionCoordinator` | `reset()` (NEW) | `src/Tui/Question/QuestionCoordinator.php` |
| `UsageProjection` (in state) | new instance | constructed in `TuiSessionState` constructor |

## Implementation approach options

A) **Inline in `InteractiveMode`** — add a `switchSession()` method that does all the reset work. Simple but makes `InteractiveMode` even larger.

B) **New `SessionSwitchService`** class — injected into `InteractiveMode` and future slash command handlers. Holds the orchestration logic. **Recommended.**

```php
class SessionSwitchService {
    public function __construct(
        private AgentSessionClient $client,
        private HatfieldSessionStore $sessionStore,
        private SessionInitializer $sessionInit,
        private TranscriptProjectorInterface $projector,
        private QuestionCoordinator $questionCoord,
        private ChatScreen $screen,
    ) {}

    public function switchToNew(?StartRunRequest $request): TuiSessionState { ... }
    public function switchToResume(string $sessionId): TuiSessionState { ... }
    private function resetState(): void { ... }
}
```

## Known pitfalls
- `ChatScreen` footer is the hardest part — verify rendering path before deciding approach.
- `QuestionCoordinator` may have active callbacks referencing the old session; `reset()` must clear them all.
- If switching while a run is actively streaming, `cancel()` may need to wait for graceful stop or accept a forced reset.
- Process transport (`JsonlProcessAgentSessionClient`) spawns a subprocess; ensure old subprocess is properly terminated.
- The TUI event loop runs on `tui->run()`, which is blocking. Session switch happens within a Tick or Submit callback — must not block the event loop.
- After switch, `RuntimeEventPoller` cursor (`lastSeq`) must be correct: for resumed sessions, set from replayed events; for new sessions, start from 0.
- No compatibility fallback to old `transcript.jsonl`/`runtime-events.jsonl` unless explicitly requested.
- Runtime/TUI changes require full `castor check` before CODE-REVIEW.
- TUI must talk to runtime via `AgentSessionClient`, not AgentCore internals per deptrac boundaries.

## Out of scope
- Slash command registration and picker UI.
- Session name/list API (SESSION-01).
- Tree/branch navigation.

## Acceptance criteria
- A single TUI-facing lifecycle abstraction can switch to an existing session id or reset to a fresh pending session without rebuilding the whole CLI process.
- Switching sessions resets all per-session mutable state: transcript, `lastSeq`, poll timing/errors, activity, usage, handle/request, footer model/reasoning/context, and session start timing.
- Switching sessions resets `TranscriptProjector` and prevents projected blocks from the old session leaking into the new session.
- Open/pending question overlays and `QuestionCoordinator` state are closed/reset or switching is rejected with a clear diagnostic; no stale HITL question remains bound to the old session.
- The footer/header/session display updates to the new session id/name; `ChatScreen` no longer bakes stale session id text for the lifetime of the process.
- Process and in-process transports do not leak events from the previous run after a switch; dedup cursor is initialized from replayed history for resumed sessions.
- Switching behavior is tested for at least fresh -> resumed and resumed -> fresh transitions with no duplicate transcript blocks.
- Validation uses Castor per project rules; runtime/TUI changes require full `castor check` before CODE-REVIEW.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-08T21:50:05.792Z
- Summary: Task-explain decisions confirmed by user before task-start: (1) Accept controlled rebuild of TUI objects inside the same CLI process as the session switch lifecycle; true in-place listener/context mutation is not required for this task. (2) Switching with active HITL/questions should cancel/reset local question state rather than reject the switch. (3) SESSION-02 should include enough lazy fresh-draft support so SESSION-03 `/new` can call the lifecycle seam without creating orphan DB/session rows before the first submitted prompt. (4) Prefer the simpler runtime boundary first: do not add `AgentSessionClient` API unless necessary; fix concrete process-client/session respawn behavior if needed.
- task-explain: user approved controlled TUI loop rebuild, cancel/reset active questions on switch, lazy draft support for `/new`, and no AgentSessionClient interface expansion unless proven necessary. Starting implementation phase next.

- Validation: Reviewer verdict: REQUEST CHANGES for HEAD `00ccaa4f`.; Reviewed diff vs origin/main: 16 files, +740/-48.
- Summary: Reviewer subagent reviewed HEAD `00ccaa4f` and returned REQUEST CHANGES. Required findings: (1) `InteractiveMode` drops initial `StartRunRequest`/`--prompt` in the non-resume/non-draft branch by calling `initialize('', null)`, breaking prompt startup; (2) `TuiSessionSwitchService::cancelCurrentRun()` has an empty catch without diagnostic logging, violating AGENTS.md. Additional actionable findings: default no-arg startup now creates a lazy draft and should be explicitly documented/test-covered as intentional; draft-with-request path can drop first user message because `initializeDraft()` pre-populates `state->request`; stale duplicate `ChatScreen` docblock; TuiRuntime→TuiApplication dependency cycle from context importing concrete switch service; weak footer update tests; missing `initializeDraft()` test; class docblock references SESSION-03 too specifically. Launching fork to fix all actionable findings.
- task-to-pr: reviewer found prompt-start regression, empty catch logging violation, draft-with-request edge case, and cleanup/test/design issues; launching review-fix fork.

- Summary: Second reviewer pass on HEAD `7aa91215` returned APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS: all prior blocking findings resolved, no critical/issues. Remaining actionable cleanup: tests should stub `TuiSessionSwitchServiceInterface` rather than concrete `TuiSessionSwitchService`; remove vestigial `TuiRuntime -> TuiApplication` deptrac allowance; fix orphaned `rmDir()` docblock in `SessionInitializerTest`; add low-cost empty-session footer test for draft footer behavior. Skipping only non-actionable future suggestion to add `consumePendingSwitch()` to the interface because current design intentionally keeps it same-layer/internal until SESSION-03 proves need.
- task-to-pr: launching cleanup fork for reviewer suggestions: interface stubs, tighter deptrac rule, test docblock placement, empty draft footer test.

- Validation: move_task(to=CODE-REVIEW) Castor gate FAILED: `test:tui` failed — tests=5, assertions=9, errors=1, failures=1.; Failure: `TuiAgentSmokeTest::testTypePromptAndVerifyTranscriptBlocks` — user block did not appear because runtime error displayed.; Failure: `TuiAgentSmokeTest::testMultiTurnConversationOrder` — timeout waiting for `❯`; pane showed runtime error `StartRunRequest::__construct(): Argument #3 ($cwd) must be of type string, null given`, called from `SubmitListener.php:121`.
- Summary: First move to CODE-REVIEW failed during full Castor quality gate at `test:tui`. TUI E2E exposed a runtime error in draft promotion: `StartRunRequest::__construct(): Argument #3 ($cwd) must be of type string, null given` from `src/Tui/Listener/SubmitListener.php:121`. Root cause: promotion creates `StartRunRequest` using `$state->request?->cwd` and `$state->request?->options` without defaults; for plain lazy draft startup, `$state->request` is null, so `cwd` and `options` are null. Task remains IN-PROGRESS. Launching a narrow fix fork.

- Summary: Gate-fix fork completed at commit `c43badb4` (`SESSION-02: Fix draft promotion request defaults`). It fixes the TUI E2E gate failure by defaulting `StartRunRequest` draft-promotion fields in `SubmitListener`: `cwd` now defaults to `''` and `options` defaults to `[]` when `state->request` is null. Added two regression tests covering plain draft null-request defaults and configured draft request value preservation.

Branch HEAD `c43badb4abff74faafa773368e6320f067d7aed3` adds a reusable TUI session switch lifecycle seam (`TuiSessionSwitchService` + runtime contract), refactors `InteractiveMode` into a same-process rebuild loop, adds lazy draft session support and draft promotion on first prompt, resets question/HITL/projector state on switch, updates `ChatScreen` session footer handling, and updates docs/tests/deptrac. Reviewer iterations fixed initial prompt startup, cancel-failure logging, draft-with-request promotion, interface layering, test/doc cleanup, and the TUI E2E draft-promotion `StartRunRequest` default bug. Prior gate attempts hit transient unrelated `ViewImageToolE2eTest` llm-real flakes; standalone `castor test:llm-real` reruns passed.

- Summary: Moving SESSION-02 back to IN-PROGRESS to address PR #109 inline review feedback. Comments: (1) clarify that the `InteractiveMode` session switch `while (true)` loop does not spin CPU because `Tui::run()` blocks on Revolt suspension until `Tui::stop()` is called; (2) add or expose proper TUI lifecycle hooks/events for session start/end/resume rather than only hard-coded switch internals. Implementation will be done by fork per orchestrator workflow.

- Summary: Additional user design constraint while review-fix fork is running: TUI session lifecycle events should be designed with future extension exposure in mind. SESSION-02 does not need to wire the full extension API yet, but event types/DTOs/dispatcher should be stable, semantic, privacy-safe, and easy to bridge later to extension hooks/listeners.
- task-review-iterate: user clarified lifecycle events should later be exposed to extensions; will verify fork output supports that direction and request follow-up fixes if needed.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-09T00:38:10.712Z
- Recorded fork run: y5yg55qkpx9f
- Validation: Verified worktree clean at HEAD `3fe82266`.; Fork reports: `castor test` PASS — 2195 tests, 6405 assertions.; Fork reports: `castor deptrac` PASS — 0 violations, 0 errors, uncovered=744, allowed=980.; Fork reports: `castor phpstan` PASS — 0 errors, 0 file errors.; Fork reports: `castor cs-check` PASS — 0 files fixed.; Fork reports: `castor test:tui` PASS — 5 tests, 18 assertions.
- Summary: Review-feedback fork completed but the fork handoff artifact was truncated; verified worktree directly. Commit `3fe82266` (`SESSION-02: Add TUI session lifecycle events`) is on branch `task/session-02-tui-session-switch-lifecycle`, clean and ahead of origin by one commit. It addresses PR #109 comments by documenting that the `InteractiveMode` switch loop blocks in `Tui::run()`/Revolt suspension rather than spinning CPU, and by adding an internal TUI session lifecycle event seam (`TuiSessionLifecycleDispatcher`, `TuiSessionLifecycleEventDTO`, `TuiSessionLifecycleEventTypeEnum`) wired through `TuiRuntimeContext` and documented in `docs/tui-architecture.md`. New dispatcher tests added. Cumulative diff vs origin/main is now 24 files (+1506/-61). User clarified lifecycle events should be shaped for future extension exposure; reviewer will verify this direction.
- task-review-iterate: fork y5yg55qkpx9f artifact was truncated; verified commit 3fe82266 and QA reports manually; launching reviewer for lifecycle-event seam and PR feedback resolution.

## Task workflow update - 2026-06-09T00:44:09.475Z
- Validation: Reviewer verdict for lifecycle-event delta at HEAD `3fe82266`: REQUEST CHANGES.; Security/privacy review OK: lifecycle DTO carries IDs/booleans/reason only, no raw prompts/tool output/session content.; Deptrac boundary review OK for current new TUI runtime types.
- Summary: Reviewer subagent reviewed lifecycle-event commit `3fe82266` and returned REQUEST CHANGES. Required fixes: (1) `TuiSessionLifecycleDispatcher::dispatch()` docblock falsely says subscriber errors do not short-circuit, but implementation propagates first exception and later subscribers are not called; update docblock to match implementation/docs/tests. (2) `docs/tui-architecture.md` and `TuiSessionLifecycleEventDTO` claim `previousSessionId` supports cross-session tracking, but `InteractiveMode` never populates it; either wire it or soften docs. Additional actionable cleanup: replace lifecycle end-reason magic strings with a semantic enum or at least typed constants, and rename/remove dead-code assertion in `testDispatchCallsSecondSubscriberAfterFirstThrows` because the test verifies the opposite. Launching fork to fix all actionable items.
- task-review-iterate: lifecycle-event reviewer found docblock contradiction and unwired previousSessionId docs/field; launching targeted fix fork.

- Summary: Lifecycle semantics fix fork completed at commit `8ba068b3` (`SESSION-02: Refine lifecycle event semantics`). It addressed all reviewer REQUEST CHANGES: corrected `TuiSessionLifecycleDispatcher::dispatch()` docblock to state subscriber exceptions propagate and later subscribers are not called; added `TuiSessionLifecycleEndReasonEnum` and typed lifecycle `endReason`; wired `previousSessionId` onto start/resume/draft-start events after switches; renamed/cleaned misleading dispatcher exception test; updated `docs/tui-architecture.md` lifecycle semantics. Verified worktree clean; branch is ahead of origin by 2 commits (`3fe82266`, `8ba068b3`). Cumulative diff vs origin/main: 25 files (+1563/-61).
- task-review-iterate: lifecycle semantics fork ehto51bvnlcy completed at 8ba068b3; all requested lifecycle doc/semantics/test fixes applied; running reviewer again.

- Validation: Reviewer verdict for HEAD `8ba068b3`: APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS.; Prior findings verified fixed: dispatch docblock, previousSessionId wiring, endReason enum, dispatcher test cleanup, lifecycle docs semantics.; PR #109 comments verified addressed: switch loop documents Revolt blocking/no CPU spin; lifecycle event seam is privacy-safe and exposed through `TuiRuntimeContext`.
- Summary: Reviewer re-reviewed HEAD `8ba068b3` and returned APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS. All prior lifecycle REQUEST CHANGES and PR #109 inline comments are verified resolved. One small actionable quality cleanup remains: `InteractiveMode::dispatchSessionLifecycleStart()` has adjacent PHPDoc blocks; merge them so tooling sees both the method description and `@param`. Launching tiny cleanup fork.
- task-review-iterate: reviewer found only a cosmetic but actionable adjacent-docblock cleanup in InteractiveMode; launching tiny fork.

- Summary: Tiny cleanup fork completed at commit `94e849ae` (`SESSION-02: Clean lifecycle startup docblock`). It merged the two adjacent PHPDoc blocks above `InteractiveMode::dispatchSessionLifecycleStart()` into a single docblock preserving the method rationale and `@param` annotation. Verified worktree clean; branch is ahead of origin by 3 review-fix commits (`3fe82266`, `8ba068b3`, `94e849ae`).

- Validation: Reviewer verdict for HEAD `94e849ae`: APPROVED.; Previous fork validation after lifecycle changes: `castor test` PASS (2195 tests), `castor deptrac` PASS, `castor phpstan` PASS, `castor cs-check` PASS, `castor test:tui` PASS, `castor test:llm-real` PASS, `castor test:controller` PASS.; Docblock cleanup fork validation: `castor phpstan` PASS, `castor cs-check` PASS, `castor test --filter=SessionLifecycle` PASS.
- Summary: Final reviewer sign-off at HEAD `94e849ae`: APPROVED. No critical, actionable, or required issues remain. Reviewer verified the docblock cleanup, full session switch lifecycle seam, lifecycle event DTO/dispatcher/end-reason enum, lazy draft sessions, reset behavior, docs, and tests. Security notes OK: lifecycle DTO intentionally omits raw prompt text/tool output/session file content; cancel failure logging is structured diagnostic logging; draft promotion uses generated session IDs from `HatfieldSessionStore`. Reviewer NTH items only: possible future move of `TuiSessionSwitchTargetDTO` if interface grows, and possible future exposure of `consumePendingSwitch()` if needed.
- task-review-iterate: final reviewer approved SESSION-02 at 94e849ae; moving back to CODE-REVIEW for full Castor gate and PR update.
